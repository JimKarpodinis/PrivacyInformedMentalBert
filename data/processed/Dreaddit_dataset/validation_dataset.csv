"I didn't understand why he wanted to get me an erection, and I certainly didn't want him to do that to me, but he did. I think I was around 11 at the time It's been 10 years. My relationship with that cousin isn't a bad one as of now. Remembering all these things has caused me some distress, even though I doubt if this event qualifies as abuse...",1
"That’s it for me. Bye, world. I run and hide inside a key repairs store. The shop attendant give me a worried look. I cannot move, even though I am fully aware I am standing in the door.",1
"I was in my front yard talking to him on the phone, when I refused to hang-up she had a temper tantrum and screamed loudly enough for the people outside to hear her say I ""got online and talked to little boys."" Her father refuses to do anything about her or the other daughter or treats me just as bad. I try to stand up for myself, I mean I am their uncle after all, but they just yell, scream and call me names anyway. After about 6 years of this happening I've become a virtual prisoner in my own house. I stay in my bedroom all day, on the computer, making things to sell or doing art.",1
"So I decided that I am going to talk to my doctor about tapering off lexapro next week when I go in to see her. I won't lie that I'm scared, but I think it is time. The only real thing that I had while starting lexapro was restless leg and increased anxiety, but this lasted about a week. So let's hear it reddit, what is a taper really like. Oh, male and 20 mg daily for a year is my timeline with the meds.",0
"I feel like I'm starting to get the control back over my life slowly. I'm resignating to my situation and I'm ready to make things better for myself. I have stable relationship with my very supportive wife, my ambitions are growing back slowly... I finnaly have hope and I could hardly ask for more. I asked my doc to lower my Effexor because I feel like the the side-effects outweigh the good it does: It doesn't really help much for my anxiety, I feel depersonalization ever since I'm on medications and finally it gives me uncontrollable cravings.",0
"This has *obviously* created some crushing tension in the apartment, with no one really having to go other than work during the day. (We've all recently moved to the area and don't really have family/mutual friends to stay with.) Flash forward to last night...I'm asleep on the couch and she comes in at 1AM, blackout drunk, shakes me awake violently to tell me of the Tinder date she just got back from and how awful it was. But the guy she had sex with last night was pretty good, etc. This goes on and on, turns to threats of violence against me for uprooting and throwing her life into whack.",1
"How do I figure out what is putting these guys off? Any advice is appreciated! TL;DR: Have been on 3 first dates over the last few months, and each I thought went well or above and beyond well, but each of them haven't wanted to go on a second date with me. What am I doing wrong? How do I figure out what I'm doing wrong?",0
"### Unforeseen Consequences and Social Blind Spots I did think of [my abuser's first name] as a stranger. I was a naive, 14-year-old kid that saw him as a potential new friend. Only in recent years have I realised how he coerced me into trusting him enough so I would visit him. I’m certainly not proud of making myself vulnerable in this way, but why am I even considering how I might have contributed to my own sexual abuse?",0
I’m just wondering how many of you have A LOT of triggers? I was abused extremely horribly as a teenager and into adulthood and I have horrible ptsd from it. I literally get triggered by everything and anything. Like someone could sneeze and it would sound similar to him and I’d freak. I freak out horribly about everything and the littlest things.,1
"I was very excited to go back to live in the street but that meant, abandoning my girlfriend. Wich, I had fallen in love with, deeply in love. She was a University graduate, came from an outstanding family, she learned to play the piano and dance Ballet at a very young age. You see the type. But nonetheless she liked me, and I liked her.",0
"i knew gay was humiliation. i tried bringing up to my dad, and he said he wouldn't care if his son was a fudge packer, nor would he care bout that son anymore. i then had to speak to the bishop of my church and tell him about me possibly being gay. my dad was in the back of the room and another man i had never met wa sitting next to him. He asked me if i had ever had any gay encounters.",1
"already a few months in. Any advice on if/how this can improve or if I should just cut my loses before I get too invested? Thanks everyone! TL;DR boyfriend currently has no motivation to move his life or our relationship forward, should I stick around and keep trying or accept incompatibilities? Am I asking for too much?",1
"Sister and I were watching the three VHS tapes we own on repeat because we literally don't have anything else. (I know, sorry for the whining. I feel very lucky that we even had a TV to share.) I should mention that this was to bully us as prior to this Dad sees me literally falling apart, starts playing video games with me more often. We get a PS2 to share and keep at his house (Jak and Daxter Bundle, so it was new and expensive) with what little money he has.",0
"If I could, I'd put security cameras all over his house so I can watch whatever he does and says. I don't even like him. I hate him, in fact- I've spent hours fantasizing about ways to kill him. When I was in high school, I picked routes that passed him and hung out in places he walked by. Does anybody know why I feel this way, or have any research on this type of behavior?",1
"But there is no certainty, and I am so scared I am going to fuck this up. I want so bad to do the work, be better, and show kindness to those who have been so kind to me. But none of that seems meaningful in the dead of night when I cannot sleep and get so sad and ruminating. I just do not know what to do to improve it or fix it. This is longer than I intended, thank you to anyone who reads this, any ideas or advice at all are appreciated.",1
"She claims that because she is a woman, nobody will believe me. I'm not exactly sure what she did to herself, but when the police came she claimed that I hit her and had a flushed cheek to show for it. Fortunately,  the police were able to put together what actually happened based on my blood trail. Thank God I was sitting when she hit me and that the blood all around me proved it otherwise I would be in jail for something I didn't do. Things have been escalating for a while and this is the second time she has been arrested in the past 3 months for assault.",0
"I am quite introverted and the broken friendship I had with my previous roommate made me feel very anxious, so I moved into an apartment on my own. I love living alone, but when I have severe anxiety attacks it becomes lonely and almost unbearable. I sometimes think so much that it feels like I am going crazy. I have terrifying thoughts and I make up scenarios in which I have some terrible condition, or I am dying. My parents know that I have anxiety, but never took it too seriously.",1
"Pretty normal life. My dad has been suffering of severe depression as long as I can remember, but he always refused to get help. I didn't notice as a child; but it wasn't as bad when I was younger. It really got bad a few years ago, when I was around 15. He gets angry at very little things and when he does, he closes off.",0
"Yep, you read the title correctly. I get anxiety from my dog, more specifically leaving my dog alone for extended periods of time. I got him when he was a puppy and at the time I lived at home with four other humans and my parents two dogs. We all worked different schedules so he wasn't left alone very often, and even when we were all gone there were other dogs their with him. A little over a year and a half ago my bf and I moved in together and my dog had some really bad separation anxiety at first.",1
"They say, that I'm the anti-Christ, Look to God, don't question it twice, Dead man, because I did it thrice, Foolish man, about to be sacrificed. Don't cry over me.",0
"I'm afraid about what they may do next, what they might say to me next, what they might ask me next. I just want to be by myself, in my own place, with my computer, my keyboard, my guitar, and my bed. I'm a teen, so I don't really have that choice, but to be honest, nobody really does, no matter  how old they are. You always have to be around people for one reason or another. I'm just never comfortable around people anymore.",1
"I am 26 but I have many years ahead of me still to go. As always, any questions please ask away, share your experiences or even just give some information on how you cope. I hope you enjoyed reading this (as morbid as it sounds) but this was the hardest to write, a step forward to finally making it public. I have quite a few things going on for the next couple of weeks so will be taking a break from writing. Expect the next part around the 15th.",0
"Hi everyone, So I am in abusive relationship. We live together. He doesn't pay for anything but his alcohol and drugs and occasionally his gas. When he's feeling generous he has been known to give me 10 dollars toward gas.",0
"Despite that, all the following is true: * We have both called each other BF/GF and referred to there being a relationship * We have had (oral, but not PIV yet) sex a few times, slept together naked, and have had many intimate conversations, including the last time we saw each other * We both mentioned early on that we aren't currently dating anyone else * We have both talked about going to specific events and doing things together in the future",0
"Meet with her today and express this is a concern for me. She says she doesn't see what the big deal is, people make mistakes and forget things. I agree and tell her they often forget what they don't care about. She doesn't agree, we talk about it. She feels I am being very black and white in my thinking.",0
I don't know how to mention this to my SO without seeming like Mulder. EDIT. Clearly what i need to do is just talk to her about it. I have a couple of examples in mind that will drive the point home. Mainly the first night i was introduced to everyone and a house warming we went to.,0
"but I'm really, really afraid of public embarrassments and awkward situations. So I was in the train station and saw this homeless lady asking for food and money. I always help homeless people if I have change in my wallet. I walked up to her, took out my wallet and pulled out this £5 cash to give her. She was kinda old, so she wasn't in a perfect physical health.",0
"I matched with a girl who I thought was pretty on a dating app. I said hi first, and she replied. We went on to introduce ourselves and ask basic questions such as what we do, whats our favorite food, music, and things like that. Then we decided to meet up in real life. I forgot whether it was me or her who suggested that we meet up.",0
"This battle has been in the making for years. It is now that the tension, the desperation for a resolution comes to a head. It is in this moment that I declare that there will be violence between me and I until one of us lay upon the ground in defeat. I will no longer accept the status quo that exists. An existence that is questionable “mediocre” at best, for with all my highs come so many lows.",0
"No I’m not. What I am saying though is that man and woman were designed to have a mate. A mate who completes you and makes you happy. A mate you can love and be loved by. I never searched for a man to make me happy or be my knight in shining armour, but he found me anyway.",0
I am constantly freaking out and unable to see friends that don't know about my diagnosis or make the friends that do feel very uncomfortable. I feel guilty because I feel as if I brought this all on myself because if I hadn't of taunted my father he would not have attacked me. I know rationally this is not true but I cannot shake the feeling. Has anyone else experienced this and is willing to give advice. The guilt is eating me up.,1
"He said he’d never love us. He acknowledges and plays with his daughter starting after she turned 6 months. He use to threaten to take her away from me. He gets delusional at times and he yelled at me “I’m going to off myself if you don’t admit that you were going to call the cops on me for calling the manager at McDonald’s an asshole!” I filmed it. So he said, “here’s your daughter try not to off yourself” He really thinks I’m going to kill myself for no reason....",0
"Now they didn't know about HF autism then but the signs were there. Bullied in school and at home, I just shut down at about age 10. Went to school ,went home , didn't talk to anybody. The schools noticed. Parents were duly notified but nothing was done.",1
Now I want to drink till I'm drunk again and my head sounds as though there is yelling when I'm the only one home. Hmm...fun times. At least I have a drs appointment coming up soon so I can bring it up. Still. These moments suck.,1
"I'm not sure if he was lying to me, she never found out the truth, she s lying, I have no idea. I really appreciate everyone's advice. I then mentioned I was under the impression from my parents that we weren't actually related but that I was happy to talk to her and that I didn't actually know. She opened that message and never responded so I guess we'll see what happens. Probably last edit: she said she has gotten a DNA test with him in the last and it says 99% he is her father.",0
"Anna claimed he was a distant friend and had been kicked out of his house in the frigid weather. My mom said nope, no way that boy stays there. Anna seemed to be telling lies again. Fast forward a few days, and Anna's mother takes her phone away after a series of lies and deceit. It turns out, the man was not a distant friend.",0
"Hardly any jobs there too. So maybe even the next town over is the only place age could find a job. I have a car, not very reliable car, at that. So she has a place to stay until she gets on her feet but no transportation. No licence to trek that 20 miles back and forth up and down the mountain even if she did get a job.",1
"I'm soo lucky/blessed that I have parents with an open home to me so that I am able to do this but I can't keep going on like this. I feel afraid to work. I feel like less of a man because of this. I worry about my future and if I'll ever get stable ground. Sorry, I needed to put my thoughts into text.",1
"I am SO PISSED just because i look tired and wearing dirty clothes doesnt mean Im up to no good. I have already filed a complaint with the bbb, attorney general, called my bank to see if i can get that money back. Im thinking while Im stuck here, to contact the local news paper. This man and his housekeeper wife, whom I forgot to add, called me a ""skank"" Im dead serious. So i was falsely accused and insulted, and had my money robbed.",1
"I don't want to be nice to him because I don't like him and certainly don't like how he treats me. I know it's not my fault and I am not a bad person. I have never had friends, family, or other partners ever accuse me of the things he accuses me of so I know it's not real. I just needed to vent because I hate being trapped in this situation. I don't have anyone I can stay with and am still waiting on housing assistance which at the very least will take another 6 months and that's if I am lucky and the wait-list isn't too long.",1
"I'm sharing this in case it helps anyone else like me. Some other ideas that were suggested by other people when I posted this elsewhere include voting early if your state allows it, and researching the candidates ahead of time (League of Women Voters is good for this: <url> If anyone has anything else to add to this list, feel free! And remember that elections in the US are in exactly one week, November 6. 1. PLAN AHEAD.",0

"Also, stemming from the same background, I am still a virgin (he obviously is not) and I’m not quire sure how I feel about engaging in sexual intercourse with him. Whenever we “talk” about sex, I feel like I’m lying about how I feel. It’s more of an interest in learning the different aspects of sex than actual sexual arousal (I’ve been questioning the possibility of asexuality). If anything, I feel kind of giddy that someone thinks of me in that way but not in the “I want to have sex with you” way. I’m trying to engage him with pictures/videos/etc., but it feels all fake to me.",0
"He took his sleeping pills before cleaning out his gun. The magazine was out, but there was a bullet stuck in the chamber. He accidentally pulled the trigger. It went straight through his arm chair and hit his dog in the head. She yelped slightly and tried to walk away before she slumped down and passed on.",0
My boyfriend M(26) and I have been dating for a year and a half. We live together. We definitely have issues were working through right now but our relationship has been pretty good. Up until a month or so ago I was making all these future plans with him and so on. I’ve been on and off taking antidepressants for the past 8 months.,0
"But that's the worst of it. I don't think my childhood was exceptional, just frustrating. But after speaking with people close to me, and going through the checklist of symptoms, it was undeniable. So I accepted the diagnosis. Eventually I got a prescription for Wellbutrin and it helped me manage many of my symptoms somewhat for the past decade.",0
"My mom finally had a response, basically my brother works very hard (and he does, he does manual work, which I know is very hard) but nothing regarding me. I don't know what to do- maybe I am overreacting but I don't know.  P.s. my brother stays out of everything, he is kind and asks me questions but doesn't play games with my sister and is usually out of the room doing something.   **tl;dr**:I feel like no matter what I do - my family is disappointed at me and if I ask to not be fun of it just gets worse.",1
"Email her? She lives in his hometown, so an in-person meeting is not possible, nor do I think it would be wise. Should I do it anonymously? Should I provide screen shots of our conversations right off the bat, or wait and see if she requests it? I feel like I may only have one shot to do this and want to make sure I do it right.",0
"She then decided to go to a party without me and said ""I would cancel my plans to see you, but you won't do the same for me. All you do is push me away and act like a complete asshole."" even though she was the one who left. I told her I didn't want to see her tonight after she tried to bait me into going over to her house. She was telling me I'm an asshole and the cause of all of her sadness, why would I want to go there?",0
"My girlfriend and I have been amazingly strong for the last 8 months, shortly before new years she told me that she feels very much in ""love"" with me but ""doesnt feel right"". She wanted an unknown amount of time away from the relationship saying only a couple of weeks and still wanted to keep the same ground rules as when were together (monogomous, etc..) Shes vague when i try and talk to her about it, stating she just feels like somethings wrong and that shes doing this so she can fix her self and come back to 'us' stronger I talked to her again last night and as always shes adamant this is because she loves me and wants us to work more then anything... Shes never lied to me before, not even over little things so i have no reason to doubt her intentions. Basically i said i feel like her backup and i wanted to breakup untill this 'problem' is resolved so today we split for a month",0
"She was already against smoking weed after college at first but now she seems to have moved to a stance where she's okay with me smoking weed as long as she's there when it happens, as in I could smoke with just her or when we're both hanging out with the same friends. I've tried asking her about it and genuinely understanding why she feels this way about it but she can't seem to describe it rationally, saying that it's a gut feeling that she gets that legitimately bothers her and gives her anxiety. She seemed very distressed talking about it and was almost at the poiint of tears saying that she wishes she knew why it bothers her so much but it does and she can't help it no matter how much she thinks about it or how much I try to explain it to her. I don't know how to explain this to her. I don't want to give up the option of smoking weed with friends but I don't want to break up with her over something like this because I love her.",1
Hey. First time posting here. I have been living in my car with my brother and cat since May. I am feeling extremely depressed/defeated right now hence why I'm posting here. I'll start from the beginning.,1
"Writing these helps sooth my own wounds, and I was wondering if people would be willing to read them/have story ideas? I mostly write shortish scenes about having to talk about it and being consoled (most from the perspective of a woman being the survivor, man being the comforter--though I'm always willing to try different genders and sexualities). I'll mostly have these on Kindle as a series, but I have some out on websites <url>    (the series is called <name>) The Kindle ones will be longer and more in depth. Please let me know--these help me and I want them to help others!",0
"I purchased her a mani/pedi off groupon for some birthday pampering. Now, I'm trying to find discounted broadway tickets (I have the tkts and ticket lottery apps), museum passes, unused CityPasses, gift cards to eateries, literally anything that I can share with her in an effort to get her mind off all that she's going through. Info about her: she's a retired secretary who loves musicals and living a healthy lifestyle. She spends all her time now volunteering at local addiction rehabilitation centers and at homeless shelters in an effort to give back to the individuals who helped out so much with my brother. She loves elephants, wine, and discount shopping.",0
"I realize that why I’m “ok” is because I am now  past the acute phase of ptsd that I developed last year. The flashbacks are better- less often and less intense. I have learned to manage the panic attacks at work - I have a process to deal with these events now, and they often work. But the reason I’m really ok is because I don’t push myself at all to make friends, or date, or expand my life beyond work and my small world. I can’t expand it.",0
"That's it. My mom made me delete it and said ""that's what is wrong with your generation, you act too grown."" Nothing about my picture was ""grown"" I was actually wearing a long white t shirt and boyfriend jeans. Even when we go to the beach with my siblings, me and my sister were wearing the exact same bikini and she said something to me about ""needing to sit my fast tailed butt down."" Mind you, my sister is two years younger than me and the bikinis weren't even provocative in a bikini sense.",1

He wouldn't take me to the hospital but I could feel the gaping wound in the back of my head and the hole in my lip my tooth had done. He kept packing. So I called the police. I couldn't see out of my left eye and clearly couldn't drive and felt I had no other option. The police department chose not to press charges.,1
The welfare office foe my county is too far and i can't get there without transportation to ask for help. I don't have any friends or family that can or are willing to take my cat and I.

Even though this is my fault because i'm an idiot.,1
"I’m going to be posting something similar in the anxiety subreddit too but I wanted to talk to you guys about this too. I was formally diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety last year. I’m on medications for this too. I’ve been having a rough week. I haven’t been able to sleep and any sleep I’ve had has been very rough, just the complete opposite of restful.",1
"I hadn't realized until a year ago, but this gave me ptsd and shaped the way I interact with men and boys. Now I'm dating a boy who is very sweet, very understanding and such, but I often find myself thinking about ending it because his behavior feels too ""man-ish"" to me, and it makes me uncomfortable and scares me. It puts me in a very irritated state - a response to feeling threatened by men in my case - and often starts ""discourse"" between us. Luckily he is very understanding and we talked about it a lot, but whenever he asks me what he's doing that makes me uncomfortable, I can't answer, I can't put it into words, which means he can't change his behavior perfectly and that the cycle will start over again. I'm fighting as hard as I can against the effects of my ptsd on my relationship, as it is very important to me to make it work, but I know when we end it, it will be partly caused by it.",1
I’m definitely keeping the child. We don’t own our house so will just go our separate ways. I’m totally open to him being part of the child’s life if he wants. I know he would be a good dad despite him turning out to be a terrible husband Thanks for the advice guys.,0

TW: physical abuse? My dad was screaming at me today and I started crying out of fear. Of course in my household crying is not allowed. Hence he physically hit me and tried to cover my mouth which led to me hitting him back out of defense. My gums ended up bleeding and I don't think anyone else was concerned about how I was feeling — they thought I was just overreacting and stuff.,1
"They are very sweet and welcoming to me, but I feel so overwhelmed with everything. I feel as though I gave up my independence to come here, which is fine, but I'm having a really hard time adjusting to everything being handed to me when I've had to provide for myself for so long. I told my boyfriend that I need supplies for the week and he responded with ""ask my mom"". I couldn't wrap my mind around that. I still cant.",1
"The worst situations were forcing me to make a statement I knew was untrue (in order to allow me to get ready for work); becoming sexually rough and chasing me into another room to force himself on me, and rages where I’ve felt threatened. These things have ruined my trust and love for him over time. The controls and double standards that are in place are extensive. So why do I still feel conflicted about leaving? I guess I need an extra push.",1
"I always feel like no one actually likes me and they just put up with me out of pity. It’s a vicious cycle, because that insecurity makes me more self-conscious and standoffish, which makes me more unlikeable. I just feel like I’m nothing but a drain on everyone and an inconvenience. I’m constantly plagued by these thoughts about what a terrible person and I am, and it’s just so exhausting. I wish I was normal.",1
"The only woman who ever treated me with respect, my nan, died a few months ago. This household is screwing with all of us. There's nothing we can do, because she refuses to seek help, so this will never change. I want to move out, but I have nowhere to go, no job, and no money. The best I can do is wait it out until someone dies, I suppose.",1
I have been reluctant to start one of these as I am really ashamed to ask for help. One of my dear friends suggested I do this as I really do not have anywhere else to ask for assistance right now. I am at a high risk for homelessness. Landlord now wants me out unless I can come up with $800 in the next couple of days. I also was recently kicked off of food stamps lately for no apparent reason and I am working to get that fixed.,1

"all the sudden all the hate turned against me again (happened often before). She yelled out, whining for her dad, who she called. i stayed calm but was totally clueless about what to do. she started breaking up with me, telling me that she will spent the night at a hotel or somewhere on the street. i shouldnt come visit her at the hospital next week ... blackmailing me basically.",0
"Back to my dad, during lunch he wanted to say some words to my GF, to encourage her to keep studying the doctorate, he said that if she felt that money was an issue, that don't let her that take her down, that doctorates in our country earn very poorly but that getting that degree would open doors to work abroad and land a job she would love. You see, my dad didn't know (well, I've told him plenty of times, but I figured he forgot at the time) that my GF's mom was a doctorate. My GF's mom openly told in front of my that she didn't earn enough for the years of study and work she did, everybody in our country knows that doctorates don't earn enough money for the effort, capacity and dedication they're required to do/have. But when my dad said those words, nobody said anything. I didn't take it as offensive.",0
He said you better get a job by Friday or the homeless shelter. I'm thinking of going to stay at my cousins place who is supportive but it's a tad dirty but I'm considering just packing up my bag left clothes and going to stay with him.

"Sometimes I feel like I’m the third wheel in their relationship. And this doesn’t even include what they may do when I’m not around! Also, whenever roommate will talk about boys or finding a boyfriend, I notice husband will quickly try to shut that idea down fast, and say he knows roommate isn’t attracted to said guy or doesn’t want/need a boyfriend. There’s definitely an emotional dependency there. I know my husband has explained to me over and over how much he helps her and how important he is in her life.",1
"She didn’t have room for it where she was currently living, it had been so long since she was able to create. We moved things out of storage, into the studio.

I bought her a clay wheel and accessories, she wanted to work in the medium again. I’ll never forget the first evening we threw clay together, it was very meaningful and romantic.",0
"So im m15 im still in school ive been through abuse when i was a kid it scarred my head i live with my mum now but i usually roam in woods playing guitar, i got diagnosed when i was 14 shit sucks gives me flashbacks whenever i close my eyes, my mind scans every goddamn thing in the area every fucking thing!, i just dont know how to explain its so complicated my brain acts weird at times i just need to know wtf is happening with me! ive only got a gf and noone else. any help is appropriated. thanks in advance",1
"My primary concern is to get her the surgery and treatment she needs to save her life. To that end, I've set up a fundraising campaign here: <url> Every little bit helps! I know it's a long shot to reach the goal, but every dollar you can spare goes a long way to help, even if the goal isn't reached. I would be so grateful for any and all assistance, even if it's just to share this story/fundraising with your family and friends.",0
"Like she knew she had gotten herself into a bad situation but now I'm just ""trying to put doubts in her head about her girlfriend"". And how it's okay because her girlfriend has depression. Well, I have severe depression too and I never hit her once nor did I cut her off from everyone. I've been severely manipulated before but I don't know if mine was ever this bad. I need answers.",1
"Then, the issue was that she was too dehydrated for a blood draw and the mental health hospital wouldn't take her without the draw. So, I had to take her home and pump her full of water and food and cross our fingers that she could get a draw in the morning. By morning, the bed had filled. So, the counselor and I took her to the Emergency room to see if they could admit her at the local hospital. There, she absolutely *refused* to have her blood drawn and the ER told me that they were just going to have to discharge her if they couldn't get the tests.",0
"As she was leaving she told me ""now I have to go back there again"" as she was sobbing. I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help. Everyone I've talked with as told me I should've gotten her phone number because looking her phone number up through our receipts and membership files is an invasion of privacy. Did I miss my only opportunity to help her by not asking for her phone number? Sorry for the sad story, I just don't know what to do and it's painful to think what is happening to her right now.",1
"It's true that I can probably be annoying (messy, absent-minded so I forget/lose things a lot, I'm also always making (possibly annoying) jokes about everything, and afraid that comes off as attention-seeking or something), but I don't really have any evidence that I was bothering anyone. In fact, it seemed like we were all having a great time. But I'm having a hard time shaking my worry that I acted like an idiot or something. I felt the same way after going to my favorite cousin's wedding last year, who I also hadn't seen in a couple years. **tl;dr**: does anyone else feel reasonably comfortable in social situations as they occur, but then torture yourself over them after they have come to pass?",1
Eventually crazyass went flat out nuts and kicked both me and it boy out. We were now homeless. And we started hanging out with a friend of mine who was also in that situation. We'll call this guy Wolf. Wolf had a thing for this girl named S. S was one of those types who cheated on her boyfriend constantly.,0
"I thought why not try and look for a girl at the gym, but as you can figure, at 3:30am there's not as much fish in the see. Though I fear any partner not sharing my passion for fitness will not bear the strict diet I follow and the amount of time and energy I invest daily into the whole topic. #**TL;DR** ish And it is also not me wanting a girlfriend right now, do or die-esque. I am also way more interested in finding a girl sharing the same passions, aspiring to achieve similar goals, sharing the same values and providing a safe haven for one another long-term rather than just having some fun and being superficial about it.",0
I have been trying to make plans recently and she keeps having things come up but i understand because i am doing it on kind of short notice. This last little bit after the break happened in about a 8 day span. TLDR: I am awkward and need some help with relationships. I feel like i ruined my chances with this girl and i am hoping i can fix it. I also may just be overreacting to things.,0
"My memory goes, I panic, breakdown, rock back and forth, sit in closets. It sucks. But it's kind of relieving at the same time because while I'm broken I'm not choosing to be dramatic. I'm not just being manipulative. It's not my fault.",1
"Quick summary... She kicked her husband out several months for physical, emotional and verbal abuse to her and the kids. Things have been going somewhat civil ever since. He has been paying her child support unmandated by the court (not because he is a good guy, but he moved in with his parents, and they make him pay her). Yesterday there was an incident involving an arguement in their driveway (in front of the 3 kids) which ended with him punching out the side window of her mini-van while her kids were inside it.",0
"and then proceeded to show me the video of the ""dumb girlfriend"" struggling to answer the question. Needless to say, I was pissed. I said I couldn't believe he would think it was possible that I might be that stupid. He insisted that he only asked me as a joke, and then I got angrier because in what world is questioning my ability to handle basic logic funny? He continued to go on the offensive insisting that he had been kidding, that of course he doesn't think I'm stupid at all, and how could I even think he would think that?",1
"That's the kind of mother who says that. My mom thinks because she donates some clothes and food to a church that she's some holy fucking roller and holier than thou. Every conversation involves me going to hell or me needing to accept her beliefs. I got to the point where I told her and my dad that the absolute only way I would ever speak to her again was if she just dropped her evangelism. I told her I wanted a mother, not a preacher.",0

"I've been trying the online dating thing recently and met a very nice guy. We've been on 3 dates so far and he's great! Funny, nice, understanding. Unfortunately I don't really feel a spark.

"Hello, This is my first time posting here and I'm not entirely sure what the protocol is or what the requirements are. That said, rent is due in three weeks and I'm worried that I won't make it in time. I'm here exploring options and seeing what assistance, if any, I could get to make it to next month. I share an apartment with my brother in Denver, who has a somewhat stable job and is able to pay his rent.",1

"(Hurt the ego, but whatever, I guess you're not always gonna be the hottest guy she's ever been with.) Then I found another thing that pretty much destroyed me - an e-mail to her high school boyfriend begging him to come visit her and have sex with her, because of how fantastic it was when they used to have sex. This was probably half a year after we had split up, and the implied comparison with me was pretty clear. Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.",1
&#x200B; I'm in our room watching some relaxing Youtube videos trying to cheer myself up. My boyfriend wants me to come out and do weekend stuff but the energy is so high out there I think it'll set off an attack. He wants to bad to help but he doesn't know how and I don't know how either. &#x200B;,1
"He purposely said the most hurtful things to me during our break up to make himself feel better. And one of the worst things of all, like I mentioned earlier, he sexually assaulted and that also happened when he knew we were breaking up. Knowing how terrible of a person he is that some people have even told me he is a narcissist or sociopath, I don't know why I still think I should have just stayed, why I should have just seen if he could change despite how he never tried to change throughout our years together. I just want to stop myself from thinking this way and fully move on and have myself realize I am so much better off, and I even try to remind myself of all the bad things he has done but it seems that lingering thought of, ""Well, was it ever that bad?"" keeps returning.",1
It was all so quick and I try and recall now what happened and my brain jumbles up the details but he finally realized what he was doing to me and stopped. I am a small girl with a very thin build at 5'8 and 125 to 130  pounds maximum and he is a big guy at 6'5 and and 265 pounds and I had no chance of getting him to stop. He started immediately after hysterically crying because I started to hysterically cry and started to feel like I couldn't breath. He spent most of the night afterhysterically crying telling me he can't live with himself after this and how he would never put his hands on a woman but something in him just snapped but I don't know how to forgive him or let it go. I'm still so shocked by what happened I have managed to stop crying and calm down but I don't know how to move on from here.,1
"So I let myself get sucked in and... The incident that occured was that I threw a fit - my arms and legs thrashing in all directions. I had no idea what was happening, I came out of it terrified and there was one guy left in the room. This guy told me I was possessed by an evil spirit. I remember thinking, he felt ""off"".",1
"until i met my new boyfriend, he is amazing, he is kind, he is sweet, he is a good student, he likes the same things as me, my family likes him, and so on... but i dont feel that passion that rush i felt with my ex, the truth is that when i started going out with my boyfriend i secretly saw my ex a few times to see if i really didnt feel nothing for him, but it was disgusting, i didnt even want him to touch me, i feel bad with myself i didnt want him, but still, i was there. then i kinda realized i felt nothing love related for him and it was ok, HE was HURT when he knew i was dating this boy and he even begged me to stay but of course not. but now the problem is that when im with my boyfriend i dont feel like i love him, like that thing you kinda have to feel with a new love, i just feel ""ok"" with him, and i catch myself thinking about my ex from time to time, remembering all the good things we had and it drives me crazy because i know that if i see him again i wont feel that way, that ""love"" that my mind makes me think stills there. and recently i found out that he has a girl and he is actually enjoying the experience and i got so mad and so hurt (i know i dont have any right to feel that way) i felt betrayed and I STILL feel that way, i gross myself out.",1
"We are 21 now, both turning 22 next month. It started off as friendly catching up, but things have gotten more romantic and we have been hanging out a lot more. I wasn’t sure we could ever be together again, but I no longer have feelings of sadness or resentment regarding what he did to me. I have noticed by the way he carries himself now, he has definitely matured. I guess I just want to know when or if I should tell him I hooked up with his friends?",0

I am scared of finishing them since I know going back to it won’t be the same. After I finish them everything about it just feels so empty, like it has no value anymore. Knowing I can never experience it the same way again makes me not want it to end. I go from loving it and then afterwards never wanting anything to do with it anymore.",0

This happened pretty often and I never really paid no mind to it, once again, I was a kid and didn't really think anything of it. I remember her taking me to my grandparents (her side) for the weekend quite a few times - and being horribly saddened by just being dumped off by her so she could go see different men.

If I go to an interview with no expectations at all, not even wanting the job (I've done this a few times for practice interviewing), it'll turn out great. What are your thoughts on this?

"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD (theoretically CPTSD but that's not an official diagnosis so whatever). It's been 3 years since I escaped my abuser who abused me for 3 years as well. However because I was so young (high school/college), people have disregarded the validity of my abuse- which results in me hiding it from the world. That sucks, but it's not as bad as what it does to me. On top of crippling anxiety about everyday life, I have a terrible fear of commitment that I didn't realize I had until I moved in with my current boyfriend.",1

She’s been remembering some things from her childhood, and, with the help of her therapist, is trying to process and heal. We don’t live in the same area, and when we got together about a month ago, she filled me in on some of those issues. About a week later, she told me that she was taking a break from electronics in order to try to process and heal, and that she and her therapist had been talking about it for a while. She said she was putting her phone on airplane mode and that she’d check it in a few days and that she’d check her email about once a week.",0
I have no friends. This has been both a cause and an effect of my anxiety and depression. I can open up and become confident once I get to know people and I have had friends before but I've gone almost a whole year with no actual friends since I have moved. Moving and the effects it had has greatly affected my confidence making new friends since I most of my interactions are with small town people who have had their friends and known other groups for years. I have a very hard time carrying on conversations with acquaintances and bridging the gap of relationships.,1

There was no reason to hate him, but I just felt this serious sense of envy toward him. He just magically knew what and how to talk to everyone, like the people that I wanted to talk to, but could never, he had already been there and done that. Now nothing is stopping me from doing what he has already done, but like, I feel like that entire pathway has just been blocked off, because of this envy. I'm really not sure whether I should start to model myself over him or just remain like this.",1

I can get sudden obsessions for things and then drop them and lose interest instantly, because my whole set of core values, ideas and principles changes constantly. And I've seen people saying that it's normal. I highly doubt it's normal to change so drastically and so quickly, because I have to accommodate to a new personality every single week, and it's disturbing. Actually, there were times when I changed from one day to the other and it's so disturbing because I didn't know what was happening to me...I just woke up feeling and being completely different, like something changed everything about me overnight.",1

The icing on the cake is that the onset of the strokes occured while Laney's mom was 8 month's pregnant. The last year and a half has been horrific.

I don't even know that I feel lonely. I was fine with all this until my boyfriend asked out of concern because he thought maybe I was depressed or something and pushing everyone away.

New Years Day - she calls to tell me about how drunk she got at a party, and how they all played a kissing game (she was the judge, and kissed at least half a dozen people, men and women), and how she was so drunk that some of her friends had to babysit her and even help her pee.",0

I was ghosted this past summer by one of few people I've ever wanted to have a relationship with, and the subsequent weeks were a quest to find sex that would distract me from the pain. Others came before, but she's the first to actually show interest in the long term. She's made these ambitious plans for our distant future, and I don't have it in my heart to tell her it'll never happen. She's the first girl to show me daily how much she cares for me, and the impending thought of breaking her heart is killing me.",1

I've tried to talk to him and ask him what I've done to make him feel this way and he just continued to curse me and belittle me. He then ignored me and posted pictures of him and a girl all over his Instagram which he knew that I would see. I wanted to make him jealous too so I posted pictures of me and my friend on Instagram with heart emojis.,0
"I see him in person 1 - 3 times per week, almost always at restaurants. If it matters, we've never been to each others apartment. It is in his lease that he can't have guests over (???). I've invited him to mine but it hasn't worked out. I have some abandonment issues from friends pretending they like me but actually secretly disliking me, so I have anxiety that he doesn't actually like me.",1
She starts to cry and apologize as well as tell me that it was all her fault regardless how many times I try to convince her otherwise. As her boyfriend it's extremely painful to watch. On our ride home from the store today she had another breakdown that lasted until we got into the house. However that's when things took a turn for the worse. She had an extremely severe panic attack.,1
I remember what it felt like to not be anxious one on medicine. none of the other ones I've been put on take any of the edge off. I can't even play xbox live without holding my breath because I get anxious that people can hear me breathe. I mute my mic to give my lungs a reprieve and then go back to holding it. thanks for reading my little rant.,1
"He also talked very condescendingly to me and the other female servers, as well as being a total arse in general. I wanted to say something SO badly, but by the time I worked up the courage, he took her arm and led her to their car. Also, I didn't want to make things worse for her by sticking up for her in public. I wrote down their license plate number and car model, but I did not get the chance to see the name on the card he paid with. I really want to reach out to this woman.",1
"My wife got in a very bad car accident a year ago and is lucky to be alive today. She is unable to work so it is just me working.

"I saw a professional for a psych evaluation and though there are no flashbacks or nightmares, I still am placed with the ptsd label. I know this isn’t something you just “get over” I just thought I moved on from my “trauma” I watched a few episodes of bojack horseman and it’s thrown me into an episode of depression Idk I’m sad, I’m mad, I get irritable I have no idea what symptoms and triggers are for me, I just keep going because if I don’t I’ll stop and fall apart. I’m like a piece of glass being held together by masking tape. I would’ve rather been told I’m a sociopath/psychopath or a narcissist due to my severe apathy towards everything.",1
"The gist of the comments received was the K isn't going to change and I should get B to go to counselling to help her with her self-esteem and give her some outside input. Of course, now K is having an online ""role playing relationship"" with some lady on Grand Theft Auto RP. B is helping him court her. She is presenting it as she is okay with this. Listen, I've known B since high school, I've known her longer then my brother.",0
"I have no worth or identity or breathe. He has blamed me for everything. I guess I am getting an abortion. I was upset his friend brought him somewhere that he ran into a girl he loves, and even though it was just a second it really hurt me. He hides me from his friends and his friends reject me but all he says is I do not like his friends.",1
"*Sigh* I fucking bailed on the plan today, to get my suicidal headcase of an ass to a hospital for admittance to a psych ward. My PTSD got triggered when I got in the ambulance, so I fucking jumped out the side door. They chased me down an alley and found me hiding behind a truck. Police got involved, more PTSD triggers, but he was nice and spoke French, which comforted me a little.",1
"I don't know if I'm able to do that, since I didn't tell the doctor the truth to begin with. I will say that my doctor very clearly didn't believe me at my follow up appointment, but my bf was in the waiting room. So I didn't admit to anything. I was teary eyed, however. From anyone's experience- is it worth it to go to the police?",1
"I'll let you know!"" I guess their wires got crossed - he meant he'd let her know whether could make it or not. But apparently, she took it as him confirming he'd go, but that he'd let her know the details, what time, etc. Her Christmas party rolls around and he last minute asked if he and I could spend it together (we were still kinda new at this pt, only 1 month into dating). I agreed.",0
"So, for a few years now I've been in a relationship with this girl who very likely has PTSD, given her upbringing. She has trust issues after suffering abuse from her birth parents at a young age, and her situation is only complicated further with bipolar depression and fetal-alcohol syndrome. She's in good hands now, living with her aunt, and is becoming independent with a job. Though I've noticed throughout our relationship that she has a tendency to push me away l, whereas I am the exact opposite, though I understand her situation; it's not her fault. She says she loves me, and I love her, but she doesn't seem comfortable showing any affection; holding hands, hugging, and kisses on the cheek are extremely rare from her.",0
"I have so much stress over money on a daily basis that sometimes it’s nearly unbearable. As I mentioned, I have received some emergency assistance in the form of loans through /r/borrow, for which I am beyond grateful. But though they provide temporary relief, the loans themselves just end up being part of this vicious circle and mire me even deeper in the debt I’m trying to escape. I know more loans aren’t the answer. So I’m looking for a different kind of help.",1
"I was cleaning my house with bleach, got a nasty burn in my throat when I woke up the next day. Day later it went away, but the day after that I got the worst body aches, chills, 100.6 fever, and dizziness for 2 days. It all cleared up but I have had this dry cough for 4 days now with no relief, it keeps me up at night, and I go into these coughing fits. What should I Do? I can't see a doctor for 2 more weeks as I am out of town on a job, i think I am a hypocongiract so ii worry a lot lol.",1
"We talked about meeting, and eventually arranged a double date. Each of us brought a friend to make things easier. The date went well and we decided to see each other again. The next two times I saw her, she began making comments on how little dating experience I had and began treating me like a child. She made comments about my weight and how I was too skinny and needed to gain weight.",0
"The way he was acting was disproportional to the situation. He is yelling at me nonstop. We pulled into a store. He kept yelling mean things at me, to the point I was asking him to stop over and over,  telling him I didn't want it to escalate and to please go into the store. It all happened so fast.",1
"This even negatively impacts me more because it causes me relationship anxiety, every time I have a freak out about travelling I start getting intrusive thoughts like ""what if I get there and realize I don't love him or I'm not attracted to him"" or when he sends me a text that makes me happy my anxiety creeps in saying that I'm secretly forcing any positive feelings I have for him. I know these are linked to my travel anxiety because they only pop up AFTER I've had a moment of freaking out thinking about the travel. Whenever we Skype, just talking to him feels like home, and talking about the upcoming trip feels just exciting, not nerve-wracking. This SUCKS, we're booking plane tickets next Wednesday and half of me is ecstatic but the anxious half of me is dreading it. I need to figure out how to calm all this anticipatory anxiety so I can just let myself enjoy my relationship, the excitement leading up to our trip, and even the trip itself (although I feel like once I'm there I'll be fine)!",1
"But that's it, just okay. Very recently she has become very very self absorbed, cold and not supportive of me and my goals. She's doing her Masters, I try my best with everything that I can for her, she suffers from generalised anxiety disorder so sometimes she can't even go outside so, I try my best to help her in anyway I can. I pay for her books if she needs some because she can't really afford them, if she needs food I help. I say this like I mind and, I don't I really don't.",0

"Well, I've been homeless for two weeks and one day. I'm homeless this time because a woman that I had previously worked for, had promised me, and I quote, ""A lot of hours."" out in Tampa. I know that with three people, the drive from where I was at, would be worth it. We would make a lot more then what it was cost in gas, so it wasn't a problem.",1
"Hi r/anxiety, So lately my anxiety/hypochondria has been through the roof. I convince myself that I have all of these symptoms and then my body actually feels like it produces them. I never know when something is actually wrong. Lately since my anxiety has gotten so bad I have begun biting my nails even worse than usual, picking my toe nails and picking any form of acne on my face or body.",1
"He did threaten to walk out when I tried to crack a third, and I stopped. He says this is so rewarding for him, but is really open about how tough it has been as well. The therapist, though she is more closed mouthed and less personally emotional, has said she has required supervision several times over me. No matter how nice they are, if I fuck up months of progress, decisions about where this is going seem likely. Getting this out seems to have helped a fair bit.",0
"They've since tried to apologise for their behaviour, and other friends have tried to encourage me to forgive them and reconnect with them. But I refuse to. I have some amazing people in my life who far more deserve my attention. I now realise these people were a huge source of some of my anxiety and cutting them off has gone a long way towards finding some stability. Don't be afraid to shut the door on those who don't deserve you!",0

"I’m just really scared about this entire situation and feel conflicted about what to do. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened as my dad has previous jail records and he’s threatened our family before and even hit us when we were smaller. I just feel really scared and really confused about everything and can’t believe it’s come to this. My mom doesn’t want us to do anything because she lives in fear and is hoping to wait until I graduate (I’m in 11th grade so we would have to wait a year and we really can’t/shouldn’t) so she can divorce him, she only wants to wait because she can’t support us by herself. If we do move I would be fine with getting a full-time job to support my family, I’m already a private tutor but I only do 1-hr a week for $20.",1
"I had an anxiety attack. When we returned home, I put my foot down. I told him that his behavior towards me was unacceptable; above all, as my (then future) husband, he needed to put my comfort and well-being above all other considerations as I did with him. He listening, apologized profusely, and we have not had any further issues with this. Until today.",0
"This subreddit truly helped me during my toughest times with PTSD and I just wanted to share my gratitude. You guys are so wise and so strong and so endlessly kind to each other.

I was abusive and my mother was scared for her life. This started at a very young age. The first time I remember her telling everyone she was scared I would kill her I was about 7. I had only raised my voice in protest because I was being severely punished for 7 days for “lying”. Me and my sisters relationship has been strained most of my life but recently she had been opening up to me about the neglect and some fat shaming she experienced as a child.,0
"I’ve started unearthing old albums; I’ve gone back to practising the drums regularly; I’ve been watching more movies and reading more books. Weirdly enough, I feel more in touch with the world.

"my mom hollered at me to come help with something in the kitchen. I went slowly feeling like I was missing out on the fun. i purpously wasn't being much help to my mom and being the little bitch that I was seeing that she had my brother on her hip as she was trying to get the stuff ready to grill she just waved me away and told me to go on then. so i walked outside and stood on the back stoop and watched. he smiled at me, and took off his shirt, then his shoes, his socks and then his pants.",0

So about a year and a half ago my best friend was apart of a somewhat controversial car accident in which he ended up getting convicted with a felony even though all the evidence pointed that he was not in the wrong. This was a tough thing for him and his family to go through both financially and emotionally. The case was finally settled about a month ago and things seemed to be looking up. 2 nights ago his younger brother ended up taking his own life. This was completely devastating news to everyone that new him.,0

"For the dog, at least, I can get stuff for cheap dog food or something, but the cat we'd need cat food. All of this weighs on my mind.

"Any help on how to stop ruminating? I work with some pretty toxic people and I can accept when people are ignorant and generally rude about my PTSD. I get it, some people are just really stupid and ignorant and won't understand how the assault affected me. But I spend WEEKS ruminating on all the things they've said, things they might say next... and the grounding techniques that my therapist suggests never stops it. How do you distract yourself from ruminating or arguing with people in your head?",1
"this was something he did with my mom as well when they were together, just as some sort of weird game, but it's till like kinda invasive, right? there was also a game called try to get out, he'd pin me down or hold me in various positions and i'd have to try to get out. he'd kiss my neck sometimes too even though i didnt really want him to, ""neck kisses"". i'm pretty sure i expressed my discomfort and he was pretty dismissive for at least a while, although it stopped at some point, but i was at least 9 or something and this stuff was still going on. my grandma says he treats me more like a wife than a daughter.",0
"It is intimately tied up in mine. She has a couple of friends but really doesn’t see them often, as previously stated she doesn’t have her own goals.. it just feels like she lives whichever life I live.

"He laid me down and went to take off his clothes, then I sprung up, ran to the bathroom, grabbed the key(only one we have), ran to the guest room and locked myself in there. Finally safe. No pillow or comforter though, just a thin blanket and some clean laundry. No matter, I couldn't fall asleep anyways. Around 6am I crept outside, took a shower, gathered most of his stuff I could find and left him a note saying I took his key, and when I'd be back at 8pm he should be gone and anything that he leaves behind goes to the bin.",0
"Since then I have heard from him once, in the form of a drunken voicemail pleading with me to forgive him and swearing that he doesn't remember anything. I may be able to believe that if I didn't know he was a manipulative pathological liar. The worst thing about this to me is that he has two kids, a little girl and a little boy who I absolutely adore. I haven't been able to see them in five years (I'm nineteen now). If anyone is reading this, and you're wondering why I didn't call the police, I did.",1
"I mean what are you suppose to do when your son is 5 and his older brother who is 16 is picking on him. He was too big for them to punish.

Fast forward to me being 18 living with my other brother.",1
"I had been raped by two different people as a kid. Between ages 5 to 8 I was raped by someone who's name I wont even call out, and when I was eleven I was raped by this odd couple (the guy raped me, the woman just was present while it was happening). I don't know if it's that or that every time I have had a crush on someone, that someone always fall for one of my best friends, but I really feel like I wont be able to have sex unless I am extremely drunk. It's not really about losing my virginity anymore, because it has already been stolen, but it's about not freaking out. How did you guys do it?",1

"Furthermore, I told him before we got really serious that I have anxiety and depression, and if he can’t handle that then I’ll understand if we end things.

I've tried flossing and even using a small needle to dislodge whatever I _think_ is in there but it still hurts long after it's healed and it still bothers me like crazy.

He is already dating someone new that is even younger than I am, I was already 13 years younger than him, and I am so worried for her that once she passes the 2 year dating mark he will repeat the pattern of abuse just as he has done in the past. I wish there was a way to at least give women and men the chance to know of what they are getting into ahead of time and then let them make the decision if they think the person is reformed or not before getting trapped in a potentially abusive relationship. It makes me sick that the pattern of abuse can continue without any transparency. I wish there was an online database of domestic abusers similar to sex offenders.",1

"He's not seeing a therapist or psych regularly, which we agreed that he needed to be doing if he was going off his meds. I'm just at this weird point with myself where I'm holding back this resentment and anger at him for not taking care of himself, even after I've explained to him how much it stresses me out and hurts me when he is not consistent with his self care and/or medication. Though things are as normal as they can be right now, I find myself getting angry when he asks me to promise to do specific things for him, like do my laundry (I'm a bit of a mess), because it just reminds me of how he wouldn't keep that promise yet he expects me to do things for him (even though they are rational requests I should take care of anyway). Well it still ended up being long, my apologies! What should I even do from here?",1

We'll make out, and fool around but in most cases, no sex.",0

We still have not been able to pay rent for May. Our landlords are trying to work with us but I believe they are becoming impatient, also since the 5th there is an additional $5 owed for every day that it is late so the amount is growing. We are also still very behind in our utility bills.

If I hadn’t have grabbed my toddlers head and pressed it against mine and ducked it would have hit us both. I was yelled at so much I could see the veins bulging in his neck as he swore at me and called me names. I held my hands over the children’s ears so they couldn’t hear. But at least he didn’t hit me. I was told repeatedly that I would be stabbed in the throat so he didn’t need to hear my voice.,1

Throughout the year I kept trying to ""win her back"" by forcing intimacy by telling her things about my past I'd never told anyone (never told her about being raped though). This just made her think I was weird. On the first day of summer I noticed she'd blocked me on all forms of social media and I no longer had a way to talk to her.",1
"It would help so much if I could use my car and not worry about the insurance etc. It would be a huge help! I would also paint a picture for the person who helps, as I am an avid painter.

I don't abuse alcohol or drugs, but I'm no different than someone who does...I have other mental health issues that I feel nobody really can understand. It has essentially rendered me a useless piece of shit. I was engaging in unhealthy behaviors up to 10 hours a day, if not more.",0
And it’s okay to fall down and have a bad day- as long as you pick yourself up and continue working toward moving forward.

"I have GAD with obsessive thoughts ( ocd) that are health related ( hypochondria ) And I am 18, I have been single my whole life, have never had a girlfriend or a kiss or anything of the sort. In elementary school I liked 4 girls throughout my time there and they all just ended up as friends and I never confessed my feelings. In middle school I liked the same girl for 2 years who rejected me. Then I liked two more girls, one who ended up as a friend and another moved. Now in high school I’ve liked about 11 girls, and no luck at ALL with any of them.",1

"My problem is, if I'm going to date anyone, they have to be aware that I struggle with PTSD and willing to at least be there for me when I need. I don't need coddling or protecting, I just need someone to hold my hand and let me cry it out, or help me through a flashback. I need someone who can *be* present and emotional, and someone I can feel comfortable having a conversation with about it. Everytime I have had a breakdown, and try to express things from the past, he audibly growls and talks about how pissed he is that it happened. He talks about what he'd do to my abusers if he ever found them.",1
"My heart races and palpitates. I've gone on autopilot, but I've never experienced anything like an out of body experience.

I never ever thought it was anxiety and I didnʻt want to diagnose myself because I know some people actually have it and I wouldnʻt want to compare my stress to that.

"As a high school junior, I'm always severely depressed whenever I make poor grades on something to the extent I'm always on the verge of crying. Every time this happens, I always feel like my future is bleak and hopeless, my rank is gonna drop like hell, and I'm worthless compared to the other people who do better than me. I'm always driven to think lesser of myself in comparison to other people and I always hate myself because of it. Now the pain is becoming unbearable to the point I nearly start screaming, sobbing alone in my bedroom out of grief. It's only the beginning of my junior year and I feel like hell has already descended upon me and there's little I can actually do.",1

He hates affection and being touched, but he constantly flirts with me, touches me, wants me to massage his ""sore"" back, wants me to sleep beside him, he cuddles me in his ""sleep""(which he has now revealed to be a fake slumber), and he always asks me about being gay and he truly is trying to understand it. Even if anything really happened between us, I wouldn't be getting a fulfilling relationship.",0

  It cleared up and I was okay but. On Monday I was thinking about humans and how the brain works and it tripped me out I got worried that because I was thinking about how the brain works that I would lose sleep and I did. That night was bad just like last time.   Also yesterday my sleep was bad I woke up like every hour of the night just like last time. I got kind of scared like I did last time but this time I think that this is fake life which is absurd but I just think about it then get really scared then I think rationally then calm down.,1

I hate going throw this on my own, not that my family don’t try to support me, I just don’t want to see mum cry again because I’m broken and she’s tryed every thing she can but nothing helps. Iv had more 5 therapist and seen at least that again in one off meeting, but I can’t engage and have developed a vague phobia towards them, I used to hide in the house when I knew I had an appointment and only come out if I was promised I didn’t have to go. So It’s been largely untreated, not throw lack of trying.  I can’t see my condition changing.",1
I don't live in the country anymore. She thinks no one will help her and has a hard time trusting people. She doesn't want to go to a shelter. I at least gave her the number for a bilingual support person from the ywca. My mom also wants my dad to pay for my graduate school degree.,0
"I don't think I ever want to go back over there. I don't think I want to involve myself in all this, and I don't know if I can handle the responsibility of being friends with my friend anymore. I can't even call her out on her behavior or how she treats her boyfriend because to her, it's all HIS fault and it's his fault every single time.

"When I'm single it's never an issue if a person I'm seeing is sleeping with others but as soon as I fall in love, I can get kind of possessive. My partner is very much the opposite. All of his relationships have been open and he's slept with pretty much all of his friends. Maybe a few months ago he told me that he'd really like it if I slept with other people. I was fairly keen but was getting weird gut fear at the thought of him sleeping with other people.",0
Yet no matter what I do the feeling of unwantedness and just pure hopelessness never fades. I  don't really know what I'm doing anymore. Is there anywhere out there where I can just  pack my stuff and live alone? Is there someone I can talk to about all  this or some kind of help for things like this? I'm currently alone and  have no one to talk about any of this.,1

&#x200B; So my question is: Would it be petty to create a small sign for my desk stating that only certain individuals are authorized to be behind my desk?

Since then it keeps happening, like I was on the train and 1 stop before my destination I got off and walked because I started panicking. then today really got to me because I needed to get a bus that goes through a tunnel to go to the pub that takes 10 mins and I physically couldn't get on the bus because of this fear.

"I have struggled all my life with weight. For the past month I have been dieting like a madman, counting calories, working out, etc. I have lose weight before in mass amounts so I do know how to diet and weigh food.

She said yeah, but was less than enthusiastic when I gave her the ticket a week later when I went to visit.",0

Suddenly everyone in the family was doing as she wished to appease her. FH is her youngest and always around when she has 'flares'. She has refused medication which made her flares better for fear of the side effects (palpitations). The flares make her cry and demand death come sooner. His sister is much less involved and appears to have the same POV I do about his mother's illness.,0
"I don't know if that's true or if my brain just can't find where all of that is supposed to fit in with this. I don't know if anyone knows what to advise here or if anything even could be, but it's just all so much. I feel like I have poison blood. TL:DR - one more straw added the family history of sexual abuse but my brothers abuse has thrown off my memories of my own childhood. It's all too complex and of course no one in the family will talk to me about it and my SO has no clue how to help me either, and I don't blame her.",1
"I actually do have access to some money where I believe I could pay off at least some of what I owe but I honestly don’t even know where I can get a number for the debts that I owe. I am afraid to even begin for several reasons. 1) I am worried I might actually be in legal trouble over this, 2) I am afraid of seeking help from someone who isn’t understanding of my situation and will just be totally horrified about what a mess it is and they will be mean to me. Are there any counseling resources available to me? I am NOT looking for a handout I just need help being walked through the steps of what I need to do to resolve this.",1
"I apologized for taking up too much of his time and space and for not respecting his boundaries, and for storming off angry; the worst part is that he eventually said he didn't accept my apology because I was still ruining his day with my insistence he apologize for speaking to me with a ""retarded"" voice. So, is our relationship doomed?   ---   **tl;dr**: My bf and I fight too much, and I think it's both our faults while he thinks it's only mine/my brain chemistry's fault.

Are the symptoms of CPTSD causing me to fail in my interactions on a day to day basis, or has there simply been a bizarre miscommunication?",1

She’s so sweet and gentle such that a complete stranger can reach into her mouth and take food away and she won’t even react.

When we were leaving that place the manager was attempting to rush us to get our apartment serviced with 24 hour notices of intimidation and behaving in an angry way leaving mean voicemails and papers at our pissed on door. She yelled at my +1 that I lived with. Toward the last few months we were documenting everything and collecting paper copies of all communication that we had with her.

"Edit: She has seen a therapist that diagnosed her with PTSD based on a fear of tornadoes (that she has never been directly affected by other than her parent, father, having them go into a basement as one was nearby).

She said she had to know and I told her that I would but she couldn’t turn it into an issue because this all happened before I even knew her. She agreed.

I saw the film this week at the L.A. Film Festival. It's the first film I know of to show what healing actually looks like, the long, slow, difficult, rewarding journey. You see Kim checking off her ACE score, meeting Donna Jackson Nakazawa, and most importantly in therapy, using EFT (tapping) and neurofeedback. You see her change and grow.",0
"Public speaking in class frequently reduced me to tears in front of the class and I could think of nothing else for weeks, from the moment it was assigned. Even listening to other people having a conversation is tiring to me, even if I'm not an active participant. As a kid I never wanted to have friends over or go to their houses because a full day of school and being around so many people was exhausting, and that is also true today at work - I just want to go home and be by myself. When I say something stupid or awkward I think about it for weeks and I still berate myself for things that happened in interactions with people ten years ago. Does any of this ring true with those of you with diagnosed SD?",1
"A guy pulls up and said the cops are on the way. He gives me a ride and we just get out of the parking lot when cops are all over, bugging everyone...especially the homeless and kids skating and stuff. We saw a few people getting arrested, but just cops messing with people. 2 good things came out of all this. I didn't get busted and I made a new friend who got me lunch and wants to see me.",0
"So I've been taking Zoloft for several months and it has been working well for anxiety/depression but I'm having some problems with it. The biggest problem is that my mind feels blank a majority of the time. When conversing with other people sometimes I feel as if I have nothing to say. I feel as if I am less witty, and also less creative. I've backed down my dosage from 100mg to 50mg with some success as I don't feel as 'spaced out'.",1
"Sometimes, when I finally got out of bed and stood up, I felt like ""Ugh, *finally*"". Still, it did not happen every morning, and even when it did, I still felt rested from the long sleep, so I thought no more of it. Also, they were never nightmares. Sadly, my body got habituated to the sleep-component of Mirtazapine after about five months, and my old warped sleep cycle slowly creeped back into my life. The only benefit left in the medicine was the mild mental cushioning it provided, but at the same time I started to suspect that what I needed wasn't cushioning but to make new constructive life decisions, that only I could make.",0
"During this time, my mother was out of work and she had to make sure she took the time to take care of her father. On his deathbed, my grandpa told our landlord, to his face and perhaps in a Will (the latter was my mother's words, not mine) that he did not want his daughter and his granddaughter to be homeless. He wanted him to take care of us and make sure we had a place to live. Unbeknownst to me, we were behind on the rent. I didn't know how much until a few years later, when I got my first job.",1
"Today we had a really bad fight and she’s at home while I’m outside... I don’t think I can go back anymore and I have nowhere to go, with the very little money I have on me and only the vaguest sense of what to do. I’m an 18 year old non binary and have had a shitty relationship with my mom ever since my dad left when I was 8. I live in a drug heavy area that is riddled with gangs and is definitely not safe at night. Shelters nearby are full, I don’t have a car, and no friends or family to turn to.",1
"Today I also had to write down all the emotions I could think of then put a color next to each word that I felt “matches” the emotion with markers. And the next page There’s an outline of a human body. I had to put each color(emotion) where I feel it on my body. I’m slightly annoyed because before all of this she’s been taking me very seriously and helping with so much, and now I feel like she’s being demeaning? Should I just see where this takes me or let her know that this feels slow and pointless at my appointment next week ?",1
"Haven't felt this excited about someone since my ex from over five months ago. This guy, J, and I met on Bumble. I haven't even met him yet, but we have spent hours chatting on the phone and laughing. It all feels really effortless. I've dated a lot since the break up and no one has clicked with me like he has.",0
"Fast forward to 3 am, I am tired and would rather just leave, even though we have convenient seats in a standing room only club and my wife is enjoying herself. She makes a passing comment that she would likely be more comfortable at home, eating food. I jump on this and say we should walk back even though it is a 45-minute walk, in heels, in the rain (which I did not check for). She agrees we leave, she slips and falls, I did not help her up, and we fight the entire way home, divorce comes up several times. This morning she won't get out of bed and won't talk to me.",1
"Update - Thanks all, I have calmed down a bit now. Will sleep on it and hopefully tackle with a clearer head tomorrow. --- **tl;dr**: Found out from stranger on Facebook my partner is most likely going to leave me, feel betrayed she posted it on a public forum like Facebook. Right now feeling useless, am introverted and quiet by nature so I don’t have much of a support network.",1
"I would rather kill myself than hurt other people so why the fuck did that even occur to me? My therapist told me I'm meant to be alive and hugged me and I don't even know why because how could I be meant to be alive if I have thoughts like this? What's the point? It honestly feels like depression or ptsd or whatever this is has stripped me of normal human emotions and humanity and I'm just like this vacuum moving around undetected that people, like my therapist, fail to see is awful and unlovable and unfixable. I don't feel anything in conversations, I have trouble with empathy sometimes.",1
"**Just a quick update - My friend has had to be rushed to hospital as she is experiencing ruptured ovaries. She will need assistance urgently as she will have to stay somewhere and recover while trying to take care of her dog. I'd really appreciate any help on this.

"Hey guys. This post is primarily obsession and compulsion orientated. I did want to post in the OCD sr but it’s pretty quiet in there. I’m a 19 year old male from the UK and in terms of my anxiety, this has truly been the worst year of my life. My most common obsession theme throughout my life has been to do with my health but for the last two years I have been dominated by intrusive thoughts about being a homosexual when I’m not and being a pedophile.",1
"I am 25 years old and recently had to stay with my mother and her new husband. My mom has had issues on and off throughout my childhood, but it is only recently that I identified her as a narcissist. We used to be very close (inappropriately so), but last week she disowned me and asked me to move out over a Reddit post she found of mine (not this account). I am moving out on Sunday, and have been enduring the silent treatment for about two weeks. I was raped by an acquaintance less than 6 months ago, and everything is hitting me all at once.",1
"In his own ways I know he loves me but he's double my body weight, he's a weight lifter, and he has blind rage that only comes out on me of all people . If I keep gambling he could permanently damage me. I'm in healthcare I know these numbers so WHY? I like to believe that he knows his limits when we're fighting but he has scared me and himself in the past. Now that chokings are happening during every incident, the accidents could be irreversible.",1
"This will probably end up being a rant. Whoever reads this, thank you. Trigger warning - sexual assault So I was 17 going to a summer camp out of state. This was my first time ever being away from my family for more than a day at a time.",0
"Now, this was my first long term serious relationship and at the time, i wasn’t aware if what he was asking me to do was normal or not. But i loved him with everything i had, so i gave up my oldest and greatest friendship for this guy i loved. Who ruined me. Myself and Alex have always been a bit flirty, but never made a move on one another. He would come to me about relationship advice, i never before had feelings for him and i would help him wholeheartedly with any issues he had.",0
"I've been looking around this sub for a while without posting. I'd like to do my part to help. Although there's a significant number of requesters who are just lazy and exaggerate their bad situations, there's a few people who actually would benefit from a bit of extra money every month. I recently spoke with a poster who claimed they had all the free time in the world and couldn't work, after I sent them $80 for a bill and a meal, they claimed they were always really busy and couldn't ever talk. **Criteria:**",0
"I was silent and looking in his eyes. After about 2 minutes, I got off him and headed back to my room. Just as I was getting to my door he yelled something nasty. I said something like ""Go to hell"", and got in my room and closed the door. He rushed the door and I had to use my body to keep the door closed when he bashed into the door with his body twice.",0
"The vet went ahead and removed it but the cost was over $4000. She has a gofundme to try to raise some bucks to pay for the surgery so I thought I'd post it here to see if anyone could help. Danika is the direct beneficiary and every dime will be going to her directly, not through any middlemen. Here is the gofundme link: <url> Thanks again everyone, any little bit helps.",0
"It did take a long time after we got together to believe he wouldn't, but now I actually believe he'd lay down his life to protect me. And I don't think I deserve that. I'm just so sad and filled with so much self-loathing today. The memories literally make me sick, make me vomit, which I don't need to be doing right now after a major surgery. I just want to erase it all.",1
"I've noticed usually people who have been in the street for a while or traveling around, and managed to avoid frying their brains with drugs or just losing it from the life, have really different opinions and ways of thinking compared to the just homeless sleeping in motels or shelters or cars and often trying to work at the same time. Do you hate other homeless aka ""hobos?"" The people in the tents? Or do you wish to or try to help them? Do you resent the middle and upper classes or do you think they're entitled to what they have?",0
"I meet a great guy, we connect immediately due to same interests. I like him a lot, he likes me too. We go on a few dates, everything goes smoothly - the conversation is still heated, the guy still shows enthusiasm regarding going out with me or me in general. After a few dates, we end up either having sex or doing something sexual, and then it all cools down. The conversations go at a much slower pace up to the point where we stop talking at all.",0
"I feel like a completely different person. My best friend suddenly died in September and I thought I was finally healing from her sudden death, and now this horrible tragedy. I feel like I can’t relate to humanity anymore except for people who have also unfortunately experienced this. Everything seems so trivial and empty. I already had anger issues before this, due to traumatic brain injuries, and now I feel a paradoxical combination of extreme rage/complete emptiness, etc.",1
"I would also paint a picture for the person who helps, as I am an avid painter. I just want to get this done  as food and everything like those necessities is taken care of, but I don't have the funds to get this done before the 7th. If you can help, it would be appreciated so much! Thank you for your help and consideration! PM me with any questions and I can explain further.",0
"I cannot remember for a fact what age we were and for exactly how long the abuse occurred. But of course I can say for sure there is a 5-year age gap between us, me being younger and female. For some reason the age 8 keeps popping into my head as to how old I was when it happened. I may have been a tiny bit older, but I don't think much younger. I know for sure it happened on more than one occasion (so I don't believe this was experimental / curiosity adolescent sexual play).",0
I am losing my place on the 20th and freaking out. I am not sure what to do as phone just got shut off and funds are depleted. The emergency funds I had are now gone as my apartment recently got broken into. I have no family and am truly at a loss here in las vegas. I feel like what might be best for me is to head back to pa where i am orignally from but without funds to pay for bus/plane out of las vegas.,1
"1) They are considered a ""small business"". I know that small businesses are still required to follow ADA standards for customers, but does the same go for employees? I haven't really read anywhere about my rights except that I can't have FMLA. 2) I feel safer to wear a heavy coat at work, I know it looks unprofessional and my boss constantly asks me to take it off. Is it unreasonable that i request an ""accommodation"" to be able to wear it and is it considered harassment if I make them aware of why I'm wearing it and still ask me to take it off?",0
He denied it and ever since then I think everyone is out to get me and that nothing ever happened and I'm just insane. I always doubt myself and it's hard to hang out with anyone because I think they all have some agenda toward me. I know logically nothing happened but when I get home I have to always check my body for bruises or anything suspicious. Then I feel shameful and want to self harm/die when I realize I'm accusing someone innocent of something so terrible and then my mind tells me nothing ever happened and I'm just nuts. It doesn't help that my family doesn't understand me and minimalizes all of my problems.,1
"My wife suffers from chronic migraines, of which, she is allergic to most of the medications they have out there for this. Our options for relief comes in the form of Methadone that is the only thing that helps, I know what a lot of you are thinking and no we do not do drugs or anything that the stigma of methadone has with it. I paid for her meds no problem for a while while she was filing for disability which many of you know is a very lengthy process. While I was working there I heard rumors that there was a commission system set up for vip hosts that includes giving the surcharges of the bottle sales to the vip host. I asked each manager and none of them could say one way or the other (strange right?).",0
"I think about it very often, wondering if I should just do it, get it over with, but something keeps holding me back. I wonder if this was my fault, that I would be turned away for not bringing it to their attention earlier, if I would be accused of participating, I keep wondering if they’ll believe an 18 year old or a 40 year old. Please, if anyone who is struggling reads this, please don’t let yourself fall into this trap. Don’t keep your mouth closed, don’t be polite, keep yourself safe no matter what that costs. I wish every day that I had quit that job sooner, that the second people warned me that I had had the nerve just to tell another manager how he was acting, that I had told anyone how uncomfortable and scared I was.",1

"I just feel like the street life has fucked my head up. There's so much I don't even know how to talk about anymore, I just hold that shit. Only person I can really chat with is a pal I know at the bar. He has PTSD and shit from the military bad, hard up alcoholic nowadays after killing people.. We talk once every few weeks and we are open and it's cool. But normal people?",1
"I told her I wanted to stay because I was told I was one of the best in the club, and for a while I was in the England squad. She convinced me “they probably say this to everyone to make them stay” and I believed her. I wasn’t allowed to wash, style my hair, shave or choose my own clothes. If I did any of these things a landslide of arguments would arise. “Who are you trying to impress?",0

Before he left he said several times that he still wants to be with me but he needs time.... -- I can't believe we are on such different pages and it was also so unexpected. I feel like he drops these bombs on me and Im left to pick up the pieces and wait around for him. --,1

"He and I have been pretty ""huggy"" the last couple years, and since he scared me I cut all physical contact off completely. He didn't try to initiate it today even though we won't be seeing each other for several weeks, so that's something. I don't plan on allowing any of it for the forseeable future - maybe unless I feel like he's really learned something or changed somehow. I don't plan on staying the night at his place or letting him stay at mine. Probably will limit our contact to public or ""other people present"" for the most part.",0
"It's been a while so I thought those feelings were long gone. At one point, I asked if Lily would come talk to me in my room, which she agreed to. In there, we made out. I don't remember a ton, but I do remember pulling away and immediately telling Lily ""oh my god, I can't believe I just did this."" Like a drunk idiot, I called my boyfriend.",0
"I'm not massively worried about it at the moment because it feels good but my question is: Is this a normal symptom of PTSD and if it continues tomorrow, should I call 111 for medical advice? I'm home alone for the next few days, should I try and stay at a friends? Thank you! Edit: Thanks for the advice, I have got in touch with my doctor and they are going to give me a call later today. Hopefully I can get this sorted out soon!",0
"He agreed. I told him a million times, when we were together and after we broke up, that loyalty is my #1 in relationship, period. I hate cheaters more than anything in the world. He knew that from the very beginning. Yet recently found out that I was cheated on for more than 6 months before we broke up.",0

I would just like to be able to get on my feet, not need government assistance, pursue my art and at least say I have a year's work experience. Thanks!",0
It’s gotten to the point where I feel like Tom is completely controlling me in the effort to “protect” me. He won’t let me go anywhere without him and when he is forced to leave me he calls me every half hour and panics and comes home if I don’t answer (I don’t purposefully not answer- occasionally I am napping or studying). I understand that the events were traumatic for Tom. I recognize that every time I go to a follow up medical appointment he is frightened. I understand that the fact that I still take medication scares him.,1
"Part of me wonders if it's not my mom's fine-tuned manipulation at work, but it's sure as hell eating at me. How do I get out of his harmful headspace? It feels like my emotions and my logic are at war right now. Even after the abuse and trauma I've endured at the hands of my mom I still question the validity of my experience because I know there are people that have it a lot worse. And seeing that video was like watching a train wreck, it made me feel so awful because of its violent nature but it also made me doubt a lot of what I'm still experiencing.",1
"I did a few times but it always just blew up in us breaking up and then me being miserable for awhile. I just don't know if I should bother anymore and commit to the fact that I'm alone and will probably be for the rest of my life.

"Around 5 months ago I started talking to Q. She's a coworker of mine who I've admired since I started at my job three years ago. I respected her and wanted to be friends, but we never talked or ran in the same social circles. 5 months ago, she invited me to a concert that her husband couldn't attend. We went as friends, had a blast, went out dancing afterwards, everything was Kosher.",0
"For the past 15 years I have had some frantic events happen in my life which I did not think effected me that badly. About 5 years ago I started feeling small signs of PTSD but just brushed it off like it wasn’t a real thing until it just kept getting worse and eating away at me, until I realized enough is enough. I thought maybe I have PTSD but then I would contradict myself and say that it’s not real and I don’t have it which would make me feel worse. I’m finally getting help and yesterday for the first time in 15 years I have officially by a doctor been diagnosed with PTSD, it’s weird to say this but for the first time ever I felt a sigh of relief like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.",0
"It was the same therapist I'd been seeing since I was little, when I was first diagnosed as ASD (at the time termed PDD-NOS, as I didn't *quite* fit the diagnostic requirements for Aspergers), and she, had honestly stopped being helpful. Just kept telling me to do the same things over and over, when I told her these solutions either didn't work, or in some cases (going out for a walk for the sake of it, rather than with an intended destination/goal, for instance) made things worse. Because if my mind's left to wander, without something to focus on, something to distract myself, it starts tearing itself apart, ripping open old wounds and rubbing salt in them; reminding me of all the shit I've screwed up in the past, ways I've failed or fallen short, and I end up worse off than when I started. So, I eventually stopped going. And then, eventually stopped taking my meds, mostly because of not having the money to afford them when my father walked out, and the house practically started falling down around our ears over a course of a couple years; the heating just before winter because we couldn't afford oil, then losing water due to burst pipes, then the gas and finally electricity due to nonpayment.",1
"Throwaway because my normal account is a common username for me.... Anyway, I've been in a lesbian relationship for near 7 years.

It isnt the best but its a roof over our heads and it's relatively cheap.",0
"Hi everyone, I'm giving writing a go to try and cope with my PTSD. I was recommended to start a blog on an app called Vocal, you get paid per 1000 views, but that doesn't really matter to me, it'd be a cool bonus though. This blog is for people who need someone to relate to, so maybe they don't feel alone anymore or that they feel as if someone can understand them. I've only started today but any support would be so appreciated, a blog is the only way of helping myself and helping others at the same time, I have one post up at the moment but I'm going to write as many as I can.",0

I haven't visited any colleges and me ecs are so bad. God I just want this to be over with.",1
The online therapist who was helping me through by depressive anxiety disorder ghosted on me without furnishing a reason. What's worse is I spent a majority of my waking time in the office and I feel so alone and out of place there. I would love to have somebody I can trust but theres always something. Ugh can't keep doing this. I've not been getting sleep over this feeling.,1
"I think this is a good conversation to have in person, but I likely won't see him for months. Would it be tacky/wildly unromantic to do this over text/email?

"I thought if I changed, if I did everything for him, he would love me like I wanted him to. I broke it off a few days ago. For good. I can't help but feel so guilty for doing so. At least when I was 12, that man went to prison for 40 years.",1
"I had no more than three consecutive appointments with each specialist before being shifted away to a different department, then being put on a 3-6 month waiting list. I eventually got a new psychologist who admitted after four sessions he didn't have a clue what to do with me, so I quit seeking treatment for a year. I've since attempted treatment again and was referred to CBT despite my protests. After two half hour sessions, they decided to refer me back to psychology. I've been on a waiting list for the past 4 months and am beginning to lose hope.",1
"I recently went through an event that was extremely traumatic. Without specifying what, it was recently everywhere on the news. It's been less than a week and not even sure what I'm dealing with here but all I know is that I feel like I am being discouraged from getting help. Most of my recommendations have been people that are ""off-record"". I've talked a little with them and have talked amongst my friends and they say they do not feel they are any help.",1
"I have trouble connecting to it on a personal level, but isn't that healthy separation of past/present? I think my present anxieties/self image issues stem from traumatic experiences, but I can talk about these things fairly openly in a way that feels rehearsed. I had a panic attack where I felt terrified and unable to move at my psych's this past Tuesday, but that's not typical for me, at least not anymore? I realized most my recent ""panic attacks"" may be ""breakdowns"" because it's not accompanied by a sense of fear, but pent up emotions I haven't been able to release resulting in a sudden loss of control... I start hyperventilating, screaming, and unleash all this pent up fury to the point where I feel detached from my emotions/self and have no control, start throwing things or hurting myself, until I'm exhausted and suddenly shut down/dissociate.",1
"I was sexually abused when I was a kid and I suspect that I have PTSD because of it. I've never been diagnosed with PTSD, but I have been diagnosed with agoraphobia. I rarely leave my house. I'm not really anxious about leaving my house and once I get somewhere, I'm usually fine. I just have a very strong feeling of not being able to leave my house.",1
"Sure it was almost 3 years ago (in July) two months into my first job out of university. I got bit in the leg and continued on like it was nothing. I only fell apart October 2016. I must have been living in survival mode until I got the call that the man who saved my life was getting recognized with a bravery award. Hearing those words, I literally felt my chest rip open and haven't been able to close the wound since.",1
"Then I came home.      My Mom pointed it out first, I went from being the class clown and the life of the party, to being the quiet guy who stood in the corner of the room. I went from a musician and avid gamer, to having no interest in any of it, and no replacement hobby. The things I had the most passion for in life were gone. It was like someone removed one of my five senses and my soul at the same time.",1
"I feel like the trust I worked so hard to build and the work I put in improving myself by going to therapy, dealing with the anger and the fact I was quick to be violent (old habits die hard...), dealing with and accepting the fact I've also got ADHD and autism, becoming a better man and not following in the footsteps of my dad is just... gone. Destroyed. Utterly fucked. I feel betrayed and completely alone because she was the only person I trusted on this entire planet. I can't even look at her even 4 days later and I've barely spoken to her since.",1

My friends are branching off and doing amazing things, and I feel I’m in the corner just trying to make it through the day, constantly dealing with chronic pain, low immunity, and PTSD. I’ve been doing a lot of therapy work around traumas I have experienced as a child, and that’s been good but also really hard. I’m just having a rough time tonight.",1
"If you don't, find one. It helps so much and may be the only way I have gotten this far. I think it is just so scary because there is nothing that feels like this isn't just how life is from now on.

I feel like there is nothing to look forward to, and all I have is just trying to fail at everything in the least humiliating way that I can.",1
"Open to any sort of help, be it public talk in the comments, talk in dm's, an offer of transport and or shelter. Links to any other places to ask for help would be nice. Happy to talk with another social media or platform - such as fb, twitter or discord.

"University makes my anxiety really bad, I'm too scared to ever ask professors for help which makes my grades worse, and I can't make any friends. All this makes my depression worse, so I end up lying in bed all the time because I'm either too depressed to go to class or having a panic attack. I know I'm going to end up failing the semester, and that's just making my anxiety worse. I' sorry for rambling, I just really don't know what to do, and I have no one to help me. Can anyone give me any advice please?",1
I'm just so angry that I'm still dealing with this. The abuse happened 10 years ago. My abuser lives a normal life and doesn't have to deal with the shit I go through every day. I'm just so angry. Thanks for reading.,1
"Things are great in my life, work, personal relationships... and then I get a Friend Suggestion  on Facebook, to see if I'd like to add someone from my past. My worst/abusive ex-boyfriend from 10 years ago recently joined FB. I hadn't been able to block him as he most likely used a fake name. I stupidly visited his page. He's different.",0
"It all is just so tiresome you know?. I am 37, with autism, chronic PTSD, pretty strong quiet borderline traits and depression. I have a 21 year old sister with full blown, not at all quiet BPD, who came over last evening and spent several hours trying to talk/guilt me into going to an uncles house to find her grass. I quit two weeks ago and did not want to, but finally agreed to go over with her. The uncle has schizophrenia and a pretty bad meth addiction.",0
"Long story short - my housemate's sister and I are super interested in each other, and I wanted to surprise her with a gift for a (very!) belated Christmas for when I get back home. We've known each other about a year, and we've been on one pretty damn romantic midnight tour of Dubai as a date. I know she is interested because she made the first move. In any case, both of us are into books, and I wanted to give her a favourite of mine (Paul Beatty's The Sellout) with the inscription: 'To X, I can only hope this book makes you laugh half as much as you make me.",0
"Only self-diagnosed as OCD until my eventual downfall. A series of events in late 2016 led me into an intense, insidious cycle of anxious rumination and fear. DPDR arose from this maelstrom of angst, something who's existence I was completely unaware of, particularly as to being related to anxiety. My perceptual world changed, my reality became crisp, shiny, radiant yet also incredibly surreal. And there I was, thrust into the middle of a world so overwhelmingly vivid that I yet felt so overwhelmingly absent from.",0
"WARNING: Messy post, I'm really all over the place, sorry guys. I have a lot on my mind. Hope you can make the best of this text. Also sorry for any spelling errors, english isn't one of my talents. Me and my boyfriend has been dating for over a year now.",1
I know this is a subreddit for domestic violence but I'm feeling really freaked out right now and when he gets aggressive I feel like I cant phone anyone because he hasnt hit me but I'm scared of him because hes really big and mentally unstable. I'm obviously looking to move out but it's hard with full time school in the fall in a really expensive city I'm struggling to find a room that I can cover. Just dont know what to do when I feel unsafe over the possibly next few weeks while I find a place. I also have pets so I cant just leave and not be in the house and I'm worried he might harm them. I also dont know what my parents should do to deal with him because they cant live like that either.,1
"Met a girl at a work convention, and really hit it off. Started dating, and really moved FAST. It felt like true love, the sex was awesome, she was so sweet. A few months in, she started zeroing in on anything she did not like, and would use anything she could against me. She would ignore my texts for periods of time, our sex life went down.",0
"Trauma changed the trajectory of my life. But I don't know if I would feel this way about my options if I wasn't anxious and wounded. My ex and I broke up because he never liked to leave the house, even for daytime activities. I wonder sometimes how I am going to feel when I hit middle age. Am I going to feel like I do now?",1
"I didn't even realize I was doing it until I felt the coldness on the skin of my temple. I thought I would feel fear but all I felt was relief and how easy it would have been to end my overthinking, torturing anxiety brain. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression officially at 12. I have severe insomnia and crippling anxiety constantly which leaves me to overwhelming dark depression. I think about everything I've said and done and it feels like fight of flight all the time.",1
"When we got to Food Lion, she got out of the car and said, “Your daddy bought you this car.” And slammed the car door and left. She apologized later. New Years eve, my mom (65) gets a call from my cousin (50-60 don’t know her age), the primary caregiver for my grandma, that my uncle (same uncle from earlier) was admitted to the hospital the day before and was ready to be released. She couldn’t pick him up because she lives an hour away. My mom and I picked him up and took him home.",0
"With trying to pay some old bills like a delinquent 500+ electric bill, I rarely had extra to save. Paying that old bill has cleared a hurdle on my path to my own place. I paid that bill and now I can get electric service when the time comes. That was a big win for me. I stayed with a relative and kind of kept pace with expenses and contributing to expenses while slowly paying down that bill.",0
It can take weeks until the problem is solved or I realise I was anxious over nothing. Recently I'm moving home due to family circumstances and it's something I didn't want to really do yet but I am having to and the place I'm moving to is lovely but I'm really anxious over it and whether I'm doing the right thing. These thoughts I'm having are causing this really dark awful feeling. Is this feeling common? I wondered if this feeling is my intuition but I don't believe it is I think it's purely anxiety.,1
"But yeah, I was afraid and dumb and feeling vulnerable when I wrote it. So thanks to you guys for calming me, and sharing your own stories (really helped alot). tldr : I was sooper stoopid, but me and my dad are still cool. But thank you to everyone who calmed me down on here when I posted. It meant alot.",0
I’m really tired. It seems like the moment that I’m starting to recover or I’m starting to get some sort of progress. I get triggered and I have to start all over again. It’s so hard to see the point in fighting all of this all the time. I still live with my abuser and sometimes I can make it.,1
"Just a simple ""seen"" status can get me into a deep downward spiral of anxiety that suppresses my hunger, takes away my will to do anything, makes me nauseous, takes away my sleep. As soon as the person texts back, I immediately feel okay. I've had relationships with girls that I've felt this way. Both times it was long term and both times I ended it. I somehow find a way to ignore every good thing I had thought before and find all that I feel she misses on other girls.",1
"And whose fault is that, then? My question to you; is it the tree’s fault that it never bothered to put in the effort to correct itself, or the hypothetical forest’s? Is it anyone’s fault at all? Could the tree ever be quite corrected, or was it destined to live out its life, becoming more and more crooked with each fucking day? I’m done.",0
There was never any plan for it to be a resource for others. It grew organically. It would be nice to get some constructive feedback. That would help me be clearer about where to go with this in the future. Thanks in advance.,0

"I met my current boyfriend (42M), let’s call him V, back in November. Things were fine, there were no red flags. We dated about a month before one day I went to warm up his coffee for him and he started screaming at me for doing it wrong, and to never do it again. I have PTSD from being raped and abused, and I get uncomfortable when guys yell in the vicinity of me, when they yell at me, it’s debilitating.

"I can't find an affordable place to rent that would fit in with my budget and I have no savings. I've looked up a lot of the shelters around me that give out meals/ have assistance, but they all close before I get out of work so I can't even drive over and ask questions. I can't call during work because I work in a very customer-centric work environment. So I guess my questions are: What should I be looking out for when living in my car? How do I go NC with my dad but still keep in contact with my family?",1
"But now, my cognitive processes feel so scrambled up and sluggish. I get so confused sometimes I have trouble filling out simple forms or answering questions on the phone.

I realized he is not very nice or smart and totally unwilling to cooperate/compromise. I wanted to leave but he had spent all my money (promising to give it back haha) and I had nowhere to go. I had the baby (he went out to eat with his mother while I was in unmedicated labor). Basically I made one stupid mistake after another and let him walk all over me and it doesn't stop there. I took care of the baby all by myself for 6 months.,1

"I am called back as a few secondary characters in a play with plenty leads and these character have one line each and sometimes no lines at all so I’m basically ensemble again. To top that off I got called back as the same four characters that like 13 girls are going to compete for and one of them is a new girl in school that this was her first audition. I’m a bit jealous and I know I shouldn’t be but I’m not jealous that the new girl got in, it’s a mix of jealousy and disappointment and dissatisfaction in myself. Plus these two guys that I might have a slight crush on are called back for main characters that kiss the leads in the play so I’m a bit mad about that too. Sorry for ranting so much and I might sound like a bitch but I just need some place to rant and this felt like the best place for it since I’m so stressed and mad at myself about this.",1
"Do I live in this cycle forever? Is there really no chance for me? I can't even begin to explain how my sibling got out, it was pure luck and they are heavily dependent on an S/O. I feel like I'm grabbing at straws. I've done this song and dance a million times.",1
"He came home from who knows where and he walks in. I asked him where he had been because i was starting to get worried. He was mad, i could see it in his eyes and hear it in his voice.

"My dad did this twice to her. He began harassing my brothers employees, telling them crazy stories that my brother was selling drugs, or that he raped someone, stories with I know are not true.

"The main source of this stress is a scholarship I am on that requires payback if you lose it, meaning I would be in the whole about $20,000 if I fail and get kicked out. The contract states you can either be kicked out or placed on probation, but I cannot find any precedent on what direction they lean. Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health.

How much time would you be willing to give (asking because a survey might take up to 30minutes, but an interview can take up to 2 hours)?

"And I don't ask for the nightmares to drain me of all energy and make me feel worse throughout the day the harder I try to be normal. I was planning on seeking counselling without my parent's knowledge for this condition once I get to university and get settled, but now I'm wondering if I'm going to be told the same thing by a therapist there. I'm not looking for a diagnosis, just people who share my experience or know what I'm talking about. I'm sorry if this seems kind of ranty or rambling, my thoughts are a bit of a mess and I'm not sure what to think. Thank you for reading all this, anyhow.",1

My head was telling me she liked me but my anxiety was telling me I was wrong about this and not to pursue any sort of romantic relationship with her.

Only to wake up the next day and have the other three friends text me that they couldn't come either for varying reasons and they were ""so sorry"". I was so upset the entire day. I had told my mom about it and she had told me that what I didn't realize was that none of them were really my close friends, since people that are actually friends don't flake out like that, plus none of them have ever come over to my place or vice versa or done anything more than hang out every now and then.",1

Anyway, so we were roommates in a super tiny apartment that didn’t even have a living room, just our two bedrooms divided by a kitchen. He was having some issues with his ex-girlfriend so he was venting to me for hours about it, and I was trying to give him as much advice as I could, because he’s my friend and I care about him. I told him this and he said he cares about me too, and then he started telling me that when he first met me, he was attracted to me but that I was too young so he felt weird.",0

Additionally, if the situation turns out better than expected, I will be pleasantly surprised, and not let down when something goes wrong.

It's been a lot to process but I'm finally getting the psychiatric attention and emotional support I need to slowly repair myself.

I'll never forget her saying ""No, you definitely have PTSD,"" and in that moment I experienced more validation of my suffering then I had in my entire life.

I’m 25f and 4 months in recovery. I’m working part time to focus on recovery but trying to find a second job so I can stop finding myself in money binds.

The only thing that I need to do is get a job and save some money, but my parents have forbidden me from doing so. At the moment my prediction is to spend the year attending classes, applying for scholarships, and working during the day before couch hopping with a few friends for a month or 2 and spending the rest of the time staying in hostels when I can or sleeping on the streets when I can't before hopefully getting into college where I'll have a reliable bed.

"I sometimes call it ""fight mode"". Extensive martial arts background has turned negative adrenalized states from inward, depressive vulnerability to external, physical reactivity. I describe it as feeling like I'm in a fight (physiologically) though I am sitting still or trying to sleep. Loss of fine motor skills, hypervigilance, scanning all surroundings and people as if they are about to hit me and I have to hit back.

I know having a back up plan doesn't sound romantic, but both he and I have discussed all of the above, and both of us are long term planners who place 'back-up' plans in place in case anything goes awry. I have always been in relationships where I was still able to be an independent unit and avoid too much commitment because I was always scared to lose my independence. But this is the first relationship where I feel like we're a really good fit, and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice I don't want to make. I will still be doing a lot of things on my own, he is also an independent person, and both of us have lived on our own for years and know we can take care of ourselves.",0

What do you think would happen if you invited an individual with mental health issues who had been homeless for many years to move directly from the street into housing?

"During the pregnancy and after the (traumatic) birth of our first child in 2013, symptoms started to intensify, including lots of depression, some manic behavior, and periodic angry outbursts. Somewhere in there we settled on a very (relatively speaking) effective combination of mental health meds that stabilized symptoms. We had our second child in 2015, after which an injury led to the discovery of a debilitating and incurable connective tissue disorder. The symptoms from this have been getting worse since then, and a good chunk of time from 2015 until now has been discovering what’s going on, coming to grips with a new reality, and managing those symptoms.

Instead of being confident in myself im resorting to internal hatred and just overall sadness.

The second best time is today.” My new favorite quote I know anxiety cripples all of us, but if we can accomplish one simple task that we’ve been putting off, it’s one stop closer to recovery. Today, I got a haircut. I made excuses for months and kept cancelling my appointments.",0
"I need help. My partner's house is a mess. That is an understatement, he has over 60 empty beverage containers on his coffee table, he has over 30 fruit flies flying around, and the odour is disgusting. I don't know what to do, it's getting harder and harder for me to go over there. It worries me because I am a clean person, everything has it's spot.",1
"I made some dumb decisions 1-2 years back. I took out some loans i shouldn't have, and i'm paying for it dearly now. I know it was dumb, but i don't feel like i deserve to starve for it, but thats just my opinion. On the other hand, i also know that i am not owed anything, and i am deeply ashamed of myself almost every day. Honestly, i am on a verge of a mental breakdown.",1
"You can see the detail on my [update 2 right <url> and here's a link to the [project github <url> So I'm begging you here, literally begging you. If there's anyone out there who would be kind enough to give me a second chance to fix my fuck up and finish my degree, would you please consider giving me some financial aid via [my goFundMe <url> I'm literally in dire need of help right here and I don't know where else to turn other than the people of the internet :( ***Kind regards,",1

"I'm going crazy. Now I'm jobless because my attempts to please/help her only screwed myself over and now I'm jobless and my mental health issues are coming out. Getting jobs is really hard for me due to some PTSD from my parents, but I'm trying my best to push through it and get a job ASAP. I'm dropping out of school (again) so I can work on my financials, but in the meantime, I NEED OUT!!!!!!! !",1
I’m asking now because my partner told me to eat a chicken schnitzel Parma instead of my ham and cheese sandwich. I freaked out. I almost had a full-on fight with him because I didn’t want to. Felt like I couldn’t. I almost broke down into tears.,1
"Hi, I will not have a home in a few weeks . I'm living with an abusive, drug addict roommate whom has constantly stolen from me. I have asked cops etc to help and I'm told restraining order.

"He turns it on first thing in the morning and turns it on the moment he gets home from work at night to play until midnight or later. Any free moment he has is spent playing this game. I'm a stay at home mom so I really look forward to talking to him, he's usually the only adult I talk to face to face during the week. Plus I love talking with him and spending time with him anyways, that's why I married him! Back when this all started, I told him that I needed him to spend more time with his kids and  I.",1
"But I just can’t do what I need to do because I am terrified that I am doing the “wrong” thing, regardless of what decision I make. But the current situation (doing nothing) is extremely detrimental as well. I feel like a total loser and I am deeply ashamed of this anxiety, though I know that it is nothing to be ashamed of. I’m confident in so many areas of my life, but anxiety targets me and I become immovable. This is one of those times.",1
"Years ago on this day, you did things to me I will not say. Although I might have lost a fight, nothing about that at all was right.

"I've never been medically diagnosed with anxiety, and I know that I would need to see a professional to officially determine if I really had anxiety, but sometimes I relate to symptoms of anxiety I see online and wonder if I should be concerned. Some things that have led me to think I may have anxiety: I've been performing on stages for all of my life, but I still find my heart racing and knees weak every time I'm on stage. One time, I messed up a performance, and when I saw my peers the next day, I had to remove myself from the situation and go to a place where I could be alone. I don't mind public speaking though.",1
"Not entirely sure if this really belongs here, but here it goes:  I (26yo F) have been diagnosed with ptsd due to many traumatic instances in my childhood including emotional/psychological abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, bullying etc. I have the best s/o anyone could ever ask for, he is extremely patient and understanding. His dad on the other hand, is a very complicated person. I'll call him P.  When I first met P, he seemed pretty shy, but very nice. He is generous, likes to offer gifts etc to people around him.",0
"   When we had our first fight I did EVERYTHING I could to gain her back in my life. I quit smoking cigarettes because she went on a ""I hate all drugs and anything smokable"" rant. I tried to be more mindful and kind because she said I was the opposite. I tried to change because I wanted my best friend back.    4 months later she let me back in and I was so fucking happy.",0
"I went through sexual assault less than a year ago and I still find I have flashbacks, I get anxious over it. I don’t tell many people this. I told one friend and a few days ago we got into an argument and he ended up saying that it was my fault it happened. I haven’t talked to him since and I’ve deleted his number, but he keeps messaging me as if nothing happened. Am I being irrational in ignoring him for this or is he just an asshole?",1
"I was never given a birthday party because it was inconvenient to have a bunch of kids over. In my pre-teen years I faced several years of having nothing and having to hide when someone knocked on the door because they were debt collectors or people who demanded payment for something. I faced the threat of homelessness, I faced abuse and horrible living conditions, I was bullied to the point of having to go to several different schools. I grew up not being loved, not being cared about, and having to fend for myself because no one would come home until 9-10 at night. I grew up being ashamed of myself.",0
"He would play really loud music on the speaker. It got so bad when he threw the living room table at me.. we got kicked out of at least 4 apartments. At this point we were homeless. He wouldn’t get a job, and wanted me to get out and hold a sign and pan handle for money, if I didn’t he would drive the car we lived in really fast and say he was going to kill us. He wrecked that car (small wrecks) at least ten times.",1
"But now i want that to change. My need for paxil is in direct relations to panic attacks or aggression attacks as i refer to them sometimes. I tend to get agitated easily or snap at people if I feel panicky or if I am embarrassed or put in situations I do not like I get agitated to the point of being a dick and yelling a lot. Which my family ends up being on the wrong side of my temper tantrums, my panick attacks turn into agitation and defensiveness.

"Extra: Apparently he was jailed before marrying my mom and he never told us until she found out later into the marriage. There's more into the story but I would like to know if I can file a charge on him for past incidents as well.... and I am upset that he is going to be charged for misdeamenor instead of felony. Since the victim (my mom) has enough evidences, it will be hard for him to drop the charges right? He has been avoiding the police so it took a while for the police to catch him but he paid for the bail and bailed himself out with a help of his friend. I just wished he would recieve a felony but he pleaded not guilty on the first court appearance and apparently there are more court appearances to be made befoe verdict is finalized....",1
"So, I used tap water in a neti pot. My cold seemed to get worse right after. I googled, “Can a neti pot make a cold worse?” Suddenly, information appears that if you use tap water in a neti pot you can get that brain eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri...

"It's hard for me to even type this, but today I dropped my classes after only a week of school. I've been in school for a while, just got my associate's degree in liberal arts at a community college and was planning on going to university for an English degree. I will note that the majority of my classes were online as I can't focus in an in-person class due to my social anxiety.

"So I am okay at making short-term acquaintances, but can't seem to make friends beyond professional relationships, polite greetings, small-talk, etc. I'm sure it's because I have no practice at making friends and the history of relationships I have had feel laced with feelings of betrayal - so maybe I'm self-sabotaging a little bit. But gosh, I would like someone to talk to about day to day life, hopes, worries, goals, etc. Also, I have an eleven year old son for whom I would like to model some more healthy platonic relationships.

I was late for one of my classes because I was afraid to leave my classroom. Does anyone else feel the same way? It's like I can't function normally anymore, school is such a scary place to be all of a sudden when it used to be a place I felt safe and comfortable, even though we had an open campus. Ugh.",1

I had swam maybe one meet before getting placed into this group and was completely overwhelmed.",1
"I have had SAD for about five years and in those times I tried so many things to ease the anxiety. You know, like medication, therapy, desensitising, etc. None of those seemed to do me any good.

"I read somewhere that feeling like you can't swallow is a symptom of anxiety. It usually only happens when I take pills, but lately it's expanded to nearly everything I eat or drink.

It's become a fear of choking or asphyxiating  now.",1

"I've had anxiety for a few years (I'm seventeen) and only got diagnosed properly like 7 months ago alongside depression. Over the past few months I've developed a stutter and I've been unable to form proper sentences which has given me a fear of talking to friends and even just talking in general. I'm not the smartest person in my family and have got the lowest grades but I've always been excellent with my literacy but when I'm talking to either my family or friends, the words just can't come out.

"According to [a study from <url> and its subjects, major risk factors were family problems and a child’s lack of confidence. These factors aren’t necessarily easy to influence but well worth looking into. As is another avenue that we should focus on more: Support for survivors of sexual abuse. Availability and quality of mental health care comes to mind, but it’s not solely limited to the medical field. If we want abusers to be held accountable, we have to help victims because they might not come forward otherwise.",0

I don’t know if this is a symptom of my PTSD or if there’s something else mentally wrong with me that’s being piled on top of the PTSD.

Four nights later the same thing happened :-) On our second date he told me he had anxiety issues and I just tried to listen to him. He's Spanish so English is his second language, which probably doesn't help his anxiety when talking to an American.
