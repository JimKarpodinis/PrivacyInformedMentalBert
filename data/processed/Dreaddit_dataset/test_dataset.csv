"Me and my Dad aren't on speaking terms, however we do live in the same house. Mainly because I'm not financially able to leave and live on my own. I do plan on leaving, but until I make enough money to do so I'm stuck here. I want to share what has led to this point, because to be honest I feel like I'm pathetic, weak in incapable of accomplishing anything. Everything I do to move forwards seems to be halted and I feel like I'm being pushed back.",1
"Old Man Gotama told his followers 2,500 years ago that those who are hurt are *burning* with self-pity, terror or revenge. Fast forward to about 75 years ago: Old men in universities told *their* followers that everything we do is the result of what we think and feel. By 1965 or so, Albert Ellis was using his grasp of that to dismantle the *thoughts* that kept us imprisoned in... self-pity, terror and revenge. A whole new way of psychotherapy came into being. It was called ""cognitivism.""",0
I would also be so grateful if you could just pray for her and our family during this time. Also if anyone is familiar with this type of serious health issue I would be so glad to hear about it so I know more about what she is fighting. They have told us the cultures came back streptococcus pneumoniae one of the most common forms of strep. Thanks for reading. <url>,0
"The problem is is that the kinds of mistakes I have made are the ones I can't even fix, because I won't be on shift to. I don't know what to say to be helpful, and to diffuse tensions. I am pretty sure all of my coworkers hate me. Just like everybody always has. I have already had panic attacks 3 different times at work now.",1
"I'm in the seventh grade and I started an after school activity last trimester. In our school, the year is split into three trimesters, and you can sign up for different activities each trimester. Last trimester, I started the club (Anime/Manga Fanclub) and we received an email with the activities that had too many people signed up. My club was in it! This really boosted my self confidence, and everyone really seemed to enjoy the activity.",0
"He used to (while single and during the early phase of our relationship) go out 5 nights a week with friends. Most of these nights would end up between midnight and 2 am. They are harmless. He doesn't drink or do drugs, they don't hang out with girls. It's he and a bunch of old men who like to play pool and poker.",0
"That's the thing that really bothers me, not so much the act of sending one text, but sending one text doesn't make me feel done, it carries the weight of every other text I'll have to send. When I see someone's name come up on my caller ID I almost always get this flare of panic, and then just ignore it, even though I actually like chatting with my friends on the phone. It hardly ever even occurs to me to actually answer it (except family because they're equally uncommunicative so it's probably really important). Not an excuse, but I think I learned all of this -- especially my refusal to answer the phone -- from my parents, my mom more than my dad. They've don't stay in touch with people they aren't living in close proximity to, and they're pretty terrible at communicating consistently with us as well.",1
"Hey everybody. I'm not really sure else where else to possibly post this. I'm currently between jobs and looking to make money in any way I can, so I was wondering if anyone would be interested in buying a cross stitch commission from me. I can do any type of pattern or design, in various sizes. Here are some examples of things I've made: <url>",0
"She wrapped her arms around me and cried for dear life I growled at him to stop at once for he had scared her..he tried to take her from me as he continued to yell and she would not let him touch her That was the final straw. And he saw it in my eyes. He turned into the fake man I fell in love with again, but I was done",0
"**I've been sober for a week and the change is awesome! ** I laugh, I stay active, I speak clearly, I look people in the eye, I get things done as I want to get them done - immediately. Living a different reality. If anyone here is being controlled by these substances I just want to remind you that they are holding you back. These coping mechanisms are making you doubt yourself and not allowing you to progress - not allowing you to know yourself without them.",0
"The worst he's ever done is yell. He does not seek out confrontation and he certainly doesn't threaten people. That's not to say he couldn't hold his own in a fight. My uncle apparently got the message and started crying and begged for forgiveness. My dad told him that he believes he could eventually forgive him, but that doesn't mean he would have anything to do with him.",0
"I might be homeless soon, I have about 500 dollars in my bank account and I NEED to get out of Massachusetts. I am going to be a college drop-out in my 3rd year due to family reason instead of academics. After a lot of research, I am contemplating between Wichita, Kansas and Columbus, Ohio. I really just want a minimum wage job where I can have a bed and private bathroom. Afterward I can get my life together and start taking programming jobs again.",1
"I will not be sharing my credit details. Though hard, I will end my friendship with her. Might think about it if she apologizes but am not sure at this moment. I will cherish connections with more on my other friends who were super nice to let me know what's happening at home. It's really frustrating not being able to confront Jenna physically but as others mentioned, I hope others who've initially believed her will realize the truth.",0
I've been thinking about this for weeks and have talked about it with her on numeral occasions and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I just don't know what to feel right now and I'm an emotional wreck. Am I overthinking or it are these reasonable things to worry about?   ---   **tl;dr**: worried what people will say about my girlfriend and I.,1
He says he doesn’t want to go to therapy (I know that’s the usual suggestion) Are there things we can do to work through this slump? Is it better to make him go out a little each day or is that too much? I don’t want to make it worse. Thanks for the help Tl;dr: how can I help my uninterested boyfriend.,0
"My girlfriend does have PTSD. She said that she thought that I might have it because of an incident that occurred in 2014. You can read about it in my post history but basically I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for pretty much no reason, the therapists responsible for it just covered themselves up and lied about it. It greatly affected me. I would definitely consider it to be a traumatic event, not just because of the actual events that transpired and the conditions of the hospital (which are pretty bad) but also just the huge betrayal of trust.",1
"I have almost constant health anxiety. It's a mixture of agoraphobia and health anxiety. I'm afraid of having some incurable disease or suddenly stopping breathing... I've been kinda iffy the past few days, just tired from lack of sleep, and I usually feel like shit after my period which triggers my anxiety. Well anyway I went out to meet my mom for some food and the first thing she says to me is ""wow are you okay?""",1
"Sorry bad English Since almost 2 weeks now I've cut myself off every social interaction because I've been confronted to doubting and all that shit and I thought that was a necessary measure to take to reborn (trough introspection, my whole life since now is involved) and stop burst out of rage and being depressed from nothing And now I keep myself at the strict minimum of social interaction, 10 days that my daily conversation is limited at some words My mental health is decreasing I'm starting to struggle breath by the mouth, now I breath and speak with the nose (probably because I don't open it enough)",1
"I’d appreciate any and all tips or suggestions about how I can best support her. My heart hurts knowing we won’t be dating anyone soon, but I love her so much I want to give her time and space to heal. In the meantime, I’ll work on being the best version of myself. TL:DR My girlfriend and I broke up due to a job that puts us 5 hours away.",0
"If you have some free time please go to the following Instagram post, find my comment under the username <username>, and give it all the likes. They will choose two winners, one based on likes, another on creativity. If you have the extra time this would make my birthday and will help me to pursue my freelance video work full time. <url> Thanks internet people!",0
"When I went back the next day he said the good news was he wasn't going to lie to me anymore. He said ""if you can take a raping like that and still come back, there's nothing I could do to make you leave."" And ""There's no point in lying any more"" He always told me from then on when he was cheating, doing something wrong, etc. I thought about turning him in. I took some pictures on my phone to maybe show the police.",1
"I simply stayed home and did nothing, I was basically a shut-in hiding from the world. I had really awful anxiety at one point, I never went to the doctor for it, but there was a time when I got a panic attack and I had to call a friend, who helped me get through it. Then everything changed, I got an opportunity to work at a really tough (to be honest I would call the working conditions atrocious), minimum-wage job but I learned a lot of life lessons (and it changed my view on society). Then I started reading more books to improve myself, and that was when I started to earn some savings. I returned to school and the first semester back I managed to get As in half of my courses.",1
"The problem is one of these guy friends. I'm typically pretty shy in new social settings and don't really like to make be at the focus of anyone's attention unless I'm comfortable with them. When I first met these guys, it was like 2 polar opposites met. I'm fairly quiet, reserved, respectful and I like to think I'm a smart person. These friends, this one friend in particular, are loud, boorish and really rude.",0
"He said he'd be back in the couple hours, never returned. I went down to the bridge spot around 10pm (~3 hours after he expected to return), recognized his bicycle, and left a note with a glowstick taped to it with my address in case he just forgot where exactly I was. Also left word with his next door tent neighbor. It's now been ~17 hours since he left his stuff here, which is obviously important, cell phone, warm coat, etc. I'll swing by the bridge area in a couple hours, but as of last night, his neighbors hadn't seen him since roughly when he left my place to return there before coming back to get his stuff.",0
"it’s the first relationship I’ve been in that feels “serious” and friends comment on how well we get along in public. We laugh a lot and we have the same sense of humor. I have been known as sort of a funny person and this is the first girl I’ve been with in a relationship that consistently makes me laugh hard. Plus she is very caring and sweet, a good friend. We have not had a serious fight in a long time, maybe more than 3 months.",0
"Because I have! And it literally makes me feel 10k x crazier than I already feel as it is. She left me alone, meds unfilled, and then told all her colleagues I was trying to scam ADHD medication off of her, so now none of them want to take my case either. Backstory, I’ve been seeing this doctor for 3 years almost now and at first I let her know my commitment issues with mental health, and having people just leave me stranded or pass me to new doctors every week and it made me bail the first few times I’ve tried to get my brain right. So we have appointments every 3-6 ish months depending on medication change.",1
"I'm livid....this only proves to me that you can't trust ANYONE not even your friggin therapist. She exploited me...pushing me to do this program wasn't to help me but she  did it for herself to try to get a raise, promotion or something. What should I do? I wrote an email to the administrator but I feel like I need to do more....I want the other participants of this program to be notified IMMEDIATELY that their sessions where they talk about very difficult/painful things, things that they don't like talking about, are being used for training purposes and God knows what else. Update: That asshole “therapist” was in fact promoted after pushing people to do this  dumb and unethical program...People that play dirty and use people get ahead.",1
"(I travel between NJ to NYC often, and $2.75 each way is pretty expensive. NJ and NYC both have Disabled rates for public transport, but the PATH which travels in-between, does not. It's total bullshit.) A free place to live in NYC? A bold plea, I realize.",0
It was a bit cringe because she was acting just too over the top. But I did give her the benefit of the doubt because that could have just been her character. However the things she were saying were very icky for my liking and I was uncomfortable about 10 minutes in. It’s very vague in my mind as it was a while ago but what I remember was that She said “ I hope you dont mind Harry cuddling me when I’m poorly and when we Netflix and chill” and “what are WE doing Friday?” (Me and Harry arranged a date night as we were both off work and college on this day. ) I remember looking at harry and kind of giving him a confused WTF look.,0
"While my friends and myself included, have high hopes that this will work out, I’m petrified because I am putting my feelings on the table. I’m going to be so damn vulnerable. While he’s expressed and shown signs that he’s just as into this as I am, if not more so, I’ve also never done this before. I’ve only been in 1 (college) relationship before this, followed by 3 years of singleness and ultimate casual fuckery. I know my feelings for him are real and I owe it to myself to fight for a chance of a relationship with someone I feel so strongly for.",1
"i quickly think to check them all out in seperate windows, and i confirm again that all of the profiles had been made very recently within the past month even up to the day of adding me. it's becoming really annoying having these profiles add me, and it's just weird that they're obviousy fake but why so specifically pose as a certain kind of person and add another? stuff about me: im a lesbian so don't date older men, and i've never really hung out with anyone older than 40 so i know i can't actually know these people. and if its some weird joke; i have no daddy issues, my dad is still around and its not really a funny joke its just weird.  i also note that one of the profiles, which has since disappeared, was really REALLY creepy.",1
"Hi Im a 19 year old kid dealing with Agoraphobia over the past year. Very boldly said, Agoraphobia is the fear of going to public places, sometimes to even leave the house. The past week, some very unpleasant things have happened in my household. I told my parents about what I've been dealing with a while back.",1
"I absolutely get along with this family member, it's just that I'm an introvert and have social anxiety, and I just really like my alone time. I am an anxious mess at even the thought of company! I hope I can pull this off without acting like a bitch or a freak. I've asked my husband to be understanding and not make me feel worse or put me on the spot. I worry the house isn't clean enough, what will we eat, etc..",1
"He's exactly what I've needed, maintains his side of an equal partnership, etc. My only problem is that, though our sex life is great, I catch myself being overly sexual sometimes, even if he shows no interest that occasional day, then feeling extremely hurt and rejected if he says that he doesn't want to do anything that day. It's not like we never do anything, I just seem to still be attached to this idea. He shows me he loves me in many different ways but this is so hurtful when I'm aware that it's ridiculous to have these expectations. I guess I'm afraid I'll never stop feeling this way and I'll end up hurt him.",0
"We’re still behind on bills, but we will catch up now we’re finally in cheaper accommodation. I’ve tried everything I can to earn some form of income, but unfortunately I’ve not been able to land a part time job, and I’ve been deemed ineligible for any welfare or study assistance. We have one last major hurdle. My tuition fees for my final semester are overdue, but I’ve been given an extension until the 24th of August and unfortunately we’re still short and running out of time. As a last resort I’ve set up a GoFundMe.",1
"Any suggestions? I apologize if this is trivial in nature. Thanks for the help. EDIT: I should also mention that when I do fall asleep, I snore REALLY loudly and I can hear myself in my sleep. My boyfriend says that it sounds like I'm not breathing or trying to breathe.",0
"I'm not competent to deal with life, despite being 21. I'm living like a parasite on my family. I'm so tired of not getting to sleep at night because I'm constantly worrying about the future and not being in control of it because I can't trust myself not to fuck everything up by panicking. It all just seems so absolutely futile. I don't know what to do anymore.",1
"I turned 15 shortly after meeting him. He started out so kind and loving. And then it just... turned. It turned from compliments into me not being able to wear certain things, say certain things, do certain things. I was barely allowed to be online, no longer able to post anything relating to the music I used to create before him.",0
"I've been dating this guy for nearly three months. We met at a bar and had a one night stand, so my expectations were very low. We started by taking it slow (dinner or takeout and a movie on Saturdays) but things felt really nice and normal. I'm used to meeting guys on apps where everything is a game and usually they are dating multiple people at once; this felt different. We met before Thanksgiving and managed to keep the momentum going through a lot of travel and three weeks spent apart.",0
"It wasn't an issue, nobody needed to know, now I don't even know *what* people apparently ""know"" and are arguing about. Somewhere under all the anger about my mum making an issue out of nothing there's something that makes me wonder if it *is* a big deal. Maybe I'm just pretending I don't care? Maybe none of this even happened? I just don't know anymore.",1
"Discovering LimeWire was like breathing in fresh mountain air in the early hours of the morning while there is dew glazed over the leaves on the trees and surrounding grass. I felt a real connection with Post Hardcore/ Alternative. During this time I knew of Anxiety, but I didn't know OF it. In other words, I considered it a personality trait and not something treatable, more or less just apart of me. Playing video games secluded in my room and swimming on a variety of swim teams kept me sane to an extent but I was living in an isolated bubble.",0
"Hi All, I’m a visitor to this sub. I’ve read the sub rules, but please let me know if i’m overstepping. This is YOUR sub. I’m a registered nurse (RN) and I’m interested in becoming a SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner).",0
"This question is not meant to be disrespectful in any way, shape, or form to people who 1) are actually diagnosed autistic, or 2) are in no way autistic, but just suffer from severe social anxieties. This is just about my experience and people who may relate. So, throughout my life, I sometimes struggled with the feeling that there is something ""different"" about myself. A lot of the time I've convinced myself it was just because of low self-esteem, paranoia, or a desire to have some type of diagnosis that would help ""solve"" or explain my awkwardness or social issues. People warn me not to jump to conclusions and it's easy to self-diagnose online in this day and age.",0
"Next week I’ll be flying for our family vacation. The flights won’t be very long (just MSY to LAS then LAX to MSY on the way home), but flying really triggers my anxiety. Mostly I just like having control over myself and my surroundings, so the idea of being in a metal tube 30,000 feet in the air is not ideal for me. I also have a lot of fears about terrorist attacks/mass shootings (movie theaters and other crowded public places are also a problem for me). I was wondering if anyone has any tips for flying anxiety/fear.",1
"All of these things were a slow burn, many of these things overlapped one another. I pushed through and finished my PhD, but now I'm worn, and after looking into it, I've realized that the psychological symptoms of stress I display are closely aligned with racism-specific PTSD. I've been through psychotherapy, but I'm not sure the therapist was adequately prepared to identify it, but I know for certain that I have PTSD. I want to begin healing now that I'm done with grad school. Where/how do I start?",1
"I have watched her try to navigate getting services while working and trying to keep her car in working order. It is no easy feat. I know you probably see a lot of GoFundMes for people who need help. Sofia is one of those people. Please, please consider helping her, even if it is just $1.",0
This month and last have been very touch and go. I have sold everything under the sun to keep my home but I am probably not going to make it. It's to the point I have sat and weighed the pros and cons of suicide (please don't talk about this subject.) But I've used up every single resource and realized I don't really know many people in the city I'm in. I don't have much of family any where close and none I could live with.,1
"She used the money from her moms house to buy her own. That was a couple weeks in a hotel, but we thought it was strong of her to be able to leave her abusive husband, and purchase a house so quickly. BACKSTORY LEADING TO: Right about 3 months ago, my petty cash came up missing ($200.00). I reported it immediately.",0
"I just saw Mystic River, and went online to look at comments and all, and I couldn't believe what I saw. If you have seen the film, people claim that where Tim Robbins character's faith went to was bound to happen because of his childhood assault. Why can't movies represent people who have survived childhood sexual assault as strong? Forrest Gump, Jenny becomes a drug addict and is a mess, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang the girl dies, Mysterious Skin becomes a male prostitute. Is that really how society sees us?",0
"Should I chill out and let her contact me?   ---   **tl;dr**: The level of communication outside of face-to-face interaction is making it difficult to maintain attraction and to set up plans with the woman I am dating, and it has become worse the last couple weeks despite our in-person interactions being consistently great. Am I being too anxious/not understanding enough or is she a bad communicator? How do I bring this up with her?",1
"I've had other things happening - lack of direction in life, nervousness about getting a job, feeling lonely by neglecting friends to do work and internships. I don't know if I don't love him anymore. I don't know if I can get past my resentment. I don't know. **Tl'dr: I feel numb to my boyfriend after a series of arguments/events that have left me not feeling loved or like a priority to my boyfriend.",1
"I have had the worst anxiety of my life recently. As a college student I am now falling behind in classes, forgetting about sorority events and not interacting with my friends. I am slowly losing my mind. My room is a mess and the only thing keeping me out of a mental hospital right now is literally my students where I student teach. I am exhausted of fighting to get out of bed everyday, shaking when I sit in class and just not talking to anyone.",1
"He forced me into sex again... And if I refused he became violent. Once I had mentioned to a friend how I hadn't wanted sex and hoped that jacking off would be good enough, and having overheard this my punishment was to be slammed into the wall and the table then thrown to the floor. When I pushed him back, telling him to quit, he kicked me down to the ground and heel kicked my back until I had a panic attack and collapsed unable to breathe... I spent most nights waiting for him to pass out, which he never did, and running through our small mini-winnie as he chased me with a knife... My dog would come out from under the table (she was a rescue who had been abused) and would trip him up, letting me escape, and he'd hold her hostage-- letting me spend most of the night in the cold, out in the boondocks where it was common for truckers to come through and cougars to attack farm animals and pets. If he felt sober enough, he would chase me down the road for a few hundred yards, and I would walk the three miles into town and wait in the park by the police station until I was sure he'd passed out...",1
"My own sleep issues were that of a cat: I could sleep anywhere, anytime for brief at most 40 minute slots of time. I was known to lean against a wall and be fast asleep. On a 20 minute taxi ride. Boom. Out.",0
"I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but I’m still worried because I don’t have gas money to get to work or buy groceries. It’s just a very helpless feeling. Thanks again to anyone who is reading this. I appreciate you.",1
"Has anyone else had this sensation? Also, if I close my mouth so my teeth are close together, I can tell that they are constantly chattering. I've definitely been much more anxious than usual lately as I work full-time at an emotionally challenging job and just decided to go back to school to pursue a Master's degree via night classes, but this shaky sensation has been a little alarming as I can't tell if it is anxiety related or something worse (which certainly contributes to the anxiety!!). If anyone has any suggestions or words of wisdom, I would be so appreciative. Thanks in advance!",1
"So I'm a student living off loans and part time work, he's a bank executive. We couldn't be at more different places in our lives, including when we met (again) back in Feb 2017. But we actually had a lot in common, including our sexuality -- both bi and both never formally dated a guy. We first met four years earlier when I was a security guard at the building he worked at. I noticed him right off the bat but was closeted at the time and never put much thought into him other than attraction, even when he became super friendly toward me.",0
"I know no break up is fun, but you know what I mean. Without going into too much detail: she was unhappy, cheated on me, broke up with me, started dating other guy. We also live together. It's been three weeks and the stress had caused my stomach to twist into knots I cannot untie... Not really sure where else got with this. I just want to stop feeling like this.",1

"I’m very frustrated by this and don’t know what to trust. On the one hand, these dreams could very well be pointing to reality. On the other, they could simply be playing out fears I had. And I just don’t know which. What do I trust?",1
at some point they laughed and i had to leave because i got physically sick to my stomach. i guess i didn't realize how much they had screwed me up. now i feel like shit though because the acquaintance is a nice person and i want to be friends with them. we were all planning a dnd game together over text for a while and i just want to be able to talk to them without thinking about my ex. any solutions or help ideas?,1
"Hello. As you can tell by the title, I'm concerned about this little girl across the street. She's able to walk and talk, but I don't think she's even 5 yet. From what I've witnessed the four years I've lived in this house, the home she lives in is not at all suitable for her as a developing child. Her parents are constantly screaming at each other in the street, and the girl is bawling, as her mom commands her to get into her car so she can take her wherever.",1

Nobody responded to what I texted.",1
She gave me an 11 pm curfew even though I was in my 20s and never gave me a key. She not picked every little thing I did even though I tried so hard to be a good guest because I thought maybe that’s why She didn’t like me. Whenever I am allowed to come here I have to bring my own food and own blanket. When I told my mom I was in such a bad mental space that I thought I was going to kill myself and didn’t feel safe to be alone she said I couldn’t come over.,1

Also there was an attempted rape on me when I was 21. I never realised how much an effect these events had on me. There is another woman that I like (F32). She is very intelligent and we talk all the time. The problem is that I am married even though my marriage is awful.,1

I don't think she should “give up having friends” and I think she should hold on to the ones who suffer from similar issues and understand (and some of them are also great, kind people that she should hold on to regardless). I think spending time with other people than me is good for her, but she is so afraid of ruining things for others. TL;DR: Girlfriend has anxiety attacks and cancels plans with friends, not all friends are very understanding. I know how to comfort her when she's feeling down, but how do I otherwise support and advise her in the best possible way?",0
"I might sound a bit bridezilla here, but I’m extremely annoyed. We set our wedding date last August for July 15th. We specifically picked this date after looking at the average temperatures for that date for the last 5 years. We determined the highs were about 7 degrees cooler than the following weekends in July, so we went with the 15th. Wouldn’t you know it, but my FMIL booked their family vacation for July.",0
"It started again, but worse. I'd bring up the conversation we had and he'd ask how dare I call him names. How dare I, he said. So, on September 7th, I decided that I had enough. I cut him out of my life.",0
"However, today I was sitting at work and for whatever reason I started thinking about the knife incident. This new person I'm dating has never done anything wrong, but I had a thought of what they would look like holding a knife. It was a pretty stupid thing to think about, it caused the worst panic attack I've had in months and had to go for a walk around the block to clear my head. I don't want the event from my previous relationship to have an impact on the potential of this new one. Does anyone have any advice for breaking free from this sort of thing?",1
"I haven't posted here yet, but as everyone here has probably experienced, PTSD is one of the most isolating conditions. Even as an adult surrounded by other adults at school, I feel so isolated. It's really disappointing that other students in my class can't seem to grasp the concept of PTSD in people who aren't veterans. There is a fundamental lack of understanding that has resulted in further alienation. For some reason, dissociations in sufferers who are not former military is unacceptable.",1
For me it would start with rent. We got approved for an apartment but some shit happened and we don’t have 1st months anymore so we can’t move in. We still have time to come up with it but I doubt we will before the deadline. After we got that I have an employment opportunity lined up but I can’t start the job until after the baby so I’d just have to manage to keep the rent paid until Dec which would be after due date and minimum recovery time. After that I’d just need to make sure I had some decent savings up by then to get everything I’d need to start the gig.,0
"My mother has always been a difficult person to talk with. She is extremely stubborn, and I have never seen her consider another person’s suggestion or opinion. She usually considers helpful advice or offers of assistance to be personal attacks. When having a conversation, she doesn’t listen to the other person, but only waits for her next turn to speak. She tends to obsess about a single topic and will refuse talk about anything else.",0
"I am looking for any advice on how to cope being homless in Los Angeles and what sort of services there are out there to help. I am so determined on keeping my job, However, I feel I might not be able to if my check comes in late again and will be forced to spend the weekend on the streets. I have no valid high school diploma as I finished it in Australia and haven't been able to secure my GED due to the time limitations with working everyday and commuting between Compton and Glendale. I appreciate anybody taking the time to read this and welcome any advice. Thanks.",1
"I made a mistake as a result of being shaken up. Now she has complained to my boss but has falsely amplified my one mistake into me being absolutely negligent and incompetent. I found out about this 8 hours ago, had another flashback/panic attack, and my heart is still pounding. I've convinced myself I'm going to get fired. I know I need to go back to counseling.",1
"I was severely neglected as a child by my mother, but this isn't about the neglect (although it may make an appearance at some point), I think my twin and I were sexually abused by her first boyfriend (the man she had an affair with). I have a distinct memory of lying in my bed at night and there being a male figure crawling up towards me, this is more of a still frame though. The others however I remember vividly to a point, one was a very inappropriate tickling game where my sister was under her duvet and he was on top of her tickling, except he was also humping, I can't remember much more than that, the other is walking to his house, I remember the exact route, going in and him showing me his house, I can't remember anything once he showed me his bedroom, other than the bedding was white, I don't remember leaving or what happened in between, but I remember things like he had an Eiffel Tower figure he made in his front room. I started masturbating at a young age and I wonder if this is linked in. I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",1
"Again, I worry they'll say that if I'm sexually active, I should be able to do this just fine. -Could I get them to only not leave the room or open the door where someone walking by could see me? -Could I ask them to tell me everything as they're doing it? So I'm somewhat prepared for everything? -Could I get them to stop if I need it?",1
"(God bless.) He was very caring at a first glance, but as the relationship went on I started discovering deeper things about him. Please be understanding that at the time I dated this guy I was around 14 or 15. He got off to IRL gore. You may think, well that's weird, but that's not the abusive part.",0
"I don’t speak Amharic, but today I took him out and he bought a journal where he could write down words that confused him. I would like to make him a mini-dictionary of phrases like “I don’t feel well,” names of foods, and “I’m hungry/I’m thirsty/I’m tired” etc. in Amharic, with their English translations, so he can look for a phrase he needs and see how to say it in English. Absolutely any phrases and translations you have on hand will help.",0
"My friend made a comment that really embarrassed me because, up until that point, I hadn't realized how unusual it probably appeared. Since then, I've been more conscious of myself doing this and, while it feels like a shameful secret, I continue to do it. I know I never did this before, so I'm wondering if it has anything to do with what happened to me. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I feel like I'm the only one.",1
"* <url> * <url> Again, we arent promoting one company over another, but thought this was an opportunity for some of you that cant reach a therapist IRL to consider this method and ask some questions.

"After unsuccessfully looking for a girlfriend on dating sites and personals, I made a simple post on CL looking for a friend that basically said that my life was too much of a mess for me to really date, but I'm trying to be more social, etc. I was upfront with the fact that I have PTSD and am getting help. I was expecting mostly spam messages from bots, etc... surprisingly like 90% replies were just mostly people telling me to grow up without even knowing what my life is like or what I've gone through. The other 10% were adult babysitters and spam. This is kind of what lead to my isolation in the first place.",1
"Hi r/domestic violence! You guys were recommended by the super supportive guys over at r/twoXchromosomes where I made this post earlier in the week: <url> (tl;dr: I've been facing a lot of personal strife lately, argument on Saturday with my husband resulted in restraining and a hit to the face. We're both military members.) A few things have happened since last Saturday.",1
"I can't talk like that."" He put a hand on my shoulder and smiled and said, ""You sure are."" It goes in a circle. He made me feel better there by affirming that he thinks I'm worthwhile. Great, that'll probably get on his nerves.",0
Because i feel like nothing i do isn't even worthy of being considered a success. Because the carpet is cover in pee from animals and reminds me of my mothers house. How i used to go to school every morning covered in cat and dog urine. Every little bit of confrontation feels like world war 3 in my head. Every little feels like it gets put on me as blame and i cant deal.,1
"Kinda interesting how even when I’m not feeling awful, tiredness still makes me ruminate and feel angry. Hm. I wonder if it’s the biological sleepiness or if it’s kinda a pavlovian response because I’m so used to having terrible feelings when I sleep? Probably kinda both. Anyway, how are you all doing?",1

"I'm afraid that maybe they aren't true and I'm demonizing him in my memory because having a villain that did horrible things to me is just easier to digest than the complicated truth. The worst thing is, I can't bring myself to talk to anybody. I always felt like I wasn't bad enough to need a doctor. I felt like I could get through it on my own. Even now, its hard for me to open up to my fiance about these things.",1
There is a waitlist to be called when they become available. I do not want to start training an adult dog from the shelter to become a service dog. I think there is too much room for error if I'm not the one who socialized the dog from the beginning. Any advice or notes from those who have them would be great. Thanks.,0
"When I have a thought and that thought makes me feel good, it is because that thought is true, that thought is in alignment with my true nature, according to my higher self\infinite intelligence that thought is correct, it is the right way for me “define” myself and to go in life. When someone says to you “You are beautiful”, “I love you”, “I enjoy being around you”, … That makes you feel good, because those thoughts are TRUE, those thoughts are showing you who you are, you are loved, you are beautiful, you are and incredible person to be around with. (In my case, I feel in heaven when someone says to me “You make me feel amazing” 🙂 ) The same goes with your on thoughts and perspectives (that’s what you attract every time btw), when you define yourself/think of yourself in a way that makes you feel good, like “I feel worthy”, “I love myself”, “I love being me”, “I truly like my new shirt”, “I’m having so much fun”, “I’m at peace and relaxed”, you are going in the right way, the right direction,  forward and aligned with your dreams and passions. From feeling fine to feeling ecstasy and Infinite Love, it is true for you, those thoughts and perspectives are the ones that will serve you in amazing ways and that will bring you the tremendous benefits for you and for your life, keep choosing them, believe in them, bathe yourself in them.",0
"I offered to help but he declined. After 6 months the debt hadn't moved. It was at that time I started asking him more about it, how it was going (I think I was pretty annoying TBH,) and he would say he paid off a large portion of it. But he didn't and never followed through with the plan. i feel badly that I didn't just drop it, but I it felt like he was lying to me.",0
"He suddenly wanted to have a relationship with her, which I saw as a good thing. I said he could come over to visit as often as he wanted, he just needs to tell me before hand so I can be home. We decided to give our relationship another shot and I got pregnant again immediately. We moved into a house together, I had really horrible morning sickness this time and Bob got disgusted with my neediness and moved out again a week later, leaving me in a huge house I can't afford or maintain, again far away from any form of support necessary for a pregnant mother of a young kid. He seems to love his kid very much but has no concept of taking responsibility.",1

"We kept in touch the entire time (and he'd always seem to want me desperately, even telling me things like ""I can't wait to see you as soon as I'm back""). But when he got back, he didn't see me right away. And despite my asking him a couple of times (like, two or three), we didn't see each other for nearly two months. Eventually, I literally said ""So are we ever going to see each other again or is this just over?"" He responded by immediately asking me on a date for that week, at a nice French restaurant near his place.",0
"We had plans to move in together, a fancy $1,800/month home that she would contribute $400 or so. We spoke of children, marriage, all sorts of stuff. It's not that I thought she owed me anything for me doing these things. It's just that I felt like I did so incredibly much and it kills me that I look back and know that over a 5 month period, we only had intimate contact less than 15 times, that we never made out, outside sex (and I initiated and was rejected many, many times). Every time I brought up my frustrations regarding my unmet romantic needs, she took it as gaslighting and used it as fuel to further drive the reason why she wasn't comfortable with intimate contact.",0

"He would distract me while I drove us places, until at one point, I backed into a parked truck, and I had never been the cause of an accident before. After that, I was not allowed to drive my own car. I was not allowed to drive my own car at all after that, unless I found the keys and snuck away, which was oftentimes very difficult. The summer of 2010, he forced me to move in with him, into a terrible run down duplex off campus, so that he could keep his mother’s pair of small, under socialized dogs who were not housebroken, and his sister, who was, with her husband, to begin college classes at this same university that fall, foisted her hyper 40 pound mutt on top of the burden as well. I will not lie, and say I am the cleanest person on earth.",0

"I looked everywhere for the possible cause, did everything to make it go away. I put vicks under my nose and that helped mask some of the smell, but it was still definitely there.

"I have no problem with a few years either way, hell the last girl I dated was 6 years younger, but this is an entire decade. That's a lot. But other than the number itself I don't know if I should care this much or not. She's pretty mature for her age and I'm admitedly a bit of a late bloomer so we are in roughly the same stage of life so that's not an issue like in a lot of age differential cases.

I've been reaching out for potential roommates but the only person I know who's be interested can't move on a short notice and can't afford it till his car gets out of the shop.

"For example, she told me I was too stubborn. This is definitely true but she criticized my political opinions, my social behaviors, and my pop culture opinions in addition to just my relationship with her. She also constantly mocks me when we fight, literally repeating my words back to me in a childish/cartoony voice and putting words in my mouth. She refuses to listen to my point of view. We recently got into a fight where I thought a Christmas present my father had gotten me was cheaper than it was.",1
"Hi everyone, (edit: the title should say “after reading the symptoms” btw). I feel like I should give a little background. About 7-8 months ago I left my abusive ex-girlfriend, she was my first serious partner and we were together for about a year and a half. She pretty much ruined my life, and I experienced all kinds of abuse while I was with her (and even when we were apart), including emotional, mental and physical. Fast forward to today, I have a new relationship with the sweetest girl in the world, a brand new start since I’m a freshman in college, and there’s a good chance that I will never have to speak with or maybe even see my ex for a good while.",0

Another issue is that both women are on the autism spectrum. My wife is quite high on it and the woman is quite low on it.

He had told me a little about his past as I slowly opened up about mine, sometimes I wouldn't even talk but I'd still sit in his office and he'd make every gesture. Sometimes we wouldn't even talk about my problems but other things in life and what we were into. It was hardly ever about school, it was like I had a friend that developed into a crush real quick.",0
He causes emotional pain to me every day but I cannot get myself to leave him. He physically abuses me sometimes but it rarely leaves a mark or bruise. I feel like even if he cheats on me (again) I still won’t want to leave him. The only way I think I will leave him forever is if I end up hating him. And the only way I will hate him is if he caused physical harm that I cannot lie my way out of like I have in the past.,1
"Edit 2: This thread got so much more attention than I could have imagined, there's been so many people offering advice and sharing their life experiences.

I think I still have a long way to go, maybe these thought's will never disappear but today has been the best day since they began and it's in a large part due to the people who spoke on this thread.

"He says she is a great girl, caring for him and he thinks she loves him. He, however, felt mostly intense passion and says he misses the spiritual connection. I think its still too soon for him to know after a few days, as the group of friends returned home and he is some more time on the road.

He said he feels a bit guilty cause its mostly passion he feels and the girl seems to be really into him.",0

"I have a dog that I got during the abusive relationship that led to my PTSD,  though I could never prove it there were obvious signs that she was abused by my ex as well. She has always been very sensitive to how people are feeling and acting (when I have an episode with my celiac disease she will curl up by my stomach and won't leave my side) could this be  a starting point for me to train her to recognise when I have a major panic attack and just lay with me until it passes?

I know my teacher and the tutor there get nervous/uncomfortable around me, lately they haven't been talking to me much or coming up to me especially the tutor to ask if I need help  which they did before, my anxiety has gotten worse and I probably look more visibly uncomfortable than ever so that why they have barely asked if I needed help or said much to me ha! yet  seem more at ease with other people.",1
"My boss asked my lead, who is friends with that person about it. My lead came to me and told me that she knows that i spoke to the big boss and they both expressed to me that what i did was the right thing. i dont really trust them to keep this confidential anymore. Im worried ill gain the tattletale reputation, and people will be a little more rude than they have been. How can I feel less anxious and more positive about this situation?",1
"What's a compassionate way of telling a friend that you can't participate in certain activities with her anymore? For the record, I'm seeing Pam again next week. She wanted to go out to eat, but i told her I can't afford to. Instead she'll come over to my place. I think this would be a good time to talk to her.",0
"I hadn't laught and felt so wanted in litterally years ! So how come I'm so what ever it is I can't just say: hey want to go out to starbucks or something?

Hi everyone. For a few months now I haven't been able to get this off my mind. My abuser was my cousin who is 5-7 years older than me(24F). He is very close to my brother and father. His dad is a wonderful person and my favorite uncle.,0
Apparently it has been going on since the day they moved in together. I don't know what to tell her thought. Since her husband is a good friend of me and my husband it's kinda weird for me to say 'leave him' or 'get out' I don't want to influence any decision she makes. What should I tell her? Tl;dr: friends husband is aggresive and I don't know what to tell her,1
"My mother on the other hand tells me that she is doing all she can, when i explained to her about the way she dresses in front of him she blames him for not creating the opportunity to wear something nice. ie not going out someplace due to him preferring to do work. Listening to both sides separately have put me in a place where i am helpless and cannot do anything. All i can do is withdraw into myself and think about other things to relieve myself. Its basically that they dont understand each other.",1
"She's talked about a restraining order, but I don't know what Amanda needs to do that or what's involved. Amanda is planning on living with us for a month or so before finding a new job and apartment nearby. I think she should stay longer for safety's sake, but that's up to her. Thanks for any input. We just want to help her; I don't want to forget anything that should be obvious.",0
"Trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness. They need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. At the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. Depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” Many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. They live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right.",0
"i experience dissociation. i get this feeling like there;s a pill in my throat. i soemtimes wonder if maybe the reason i struggle so much is beacause something happened to me? but idk. i'm probably just overthinking this the way i do and making something out of nothing, but i've been wondering off and on and pushing these thougths away for a few years.",1
"When I was a kid, I suffered a kind of unlikely injury that basically ruined me mentally, and it seems like I just CAN NOT get away from it, because it's such cheap gory shock value that everyone uses it when they need cheap gory shock value. And if I'm not mentally prepared to see it I have a panic attack or just start crying. A fucking jokey homebrew cursed item on r/DND did that to me today, and I hate that my trauma is so bad that I have to stay guarded even when I'm just reading a funny thread about my favorite hobby. I'm still thinking about that fucking item. I'm so tired.",1
"3. Watch telenovelas (if you haven't seen the drama in those shows, it makes you forget about anxiety pretty quick. After all, who will Jane choose, Michael or Rafael??) 4. Go for a walk, though now that my new employment is 15 minutes away each way via walking, I am getting some decent walking in 5 days a week.",0

"I just feel so naked and unprotected. WIll this be any different with the therapist? After all I don't even know if I want to go to this therapy session, I'm so confused about myself it's unbelievable. Has anyone of you guys ever experienced this self-confusion before and can help me finding myself again? The appointment has not even yet been made and I'm already freakin' out about it, I feel kinda like an idiot right now.",1
"Don’t worry there are 3 police cases “in process.” But it is very sad how hard you have to fight to get REAL advocacy from the police for domestic violence, even with all the evidence in the world and they just drag their feet. I mean the violent incident with the gun happened almost a year ago! Where is the JUSTICE in this system of ours?! I hope to find some soon, starting with Wednesday. But I’m JUST SO SCARED to have to see him again!",1
"I understood that I was robbed of my innocence. I just wanted to hug the 15 year old version of myself and tell her that it would be okay. I have never verbalized these feelings. For the first time, I talked myself through them. For the first time, I felt comfortable talking to someone about it.",0
"I knew I was unhappy in this relationship. He has a very impulsive personality, he destroys his property and overdoses on drugs when he is angry. When I was telling him that I needed some time on my own, he would threaten to kill himself so that I felt obligated to come take care of him (happened 2 times). I would stay because I felt I had the moral obligation to make sure he is okay. I felt very manipulated.",1
"I run <url>, which seeks to tell the honest stories of people across the country in order to foster a greater understanding of one another and increase empathy. In anticipation of May being Mental Health Awareness Month, we're hoping to write about people with mental illnesses to raise awareness. If you're interested in being interviewed for a story, please send me a DM. I have OCD, myself, so I can assure you the topic will be treated with the tact it deserves. Note: We are not doing anonymous interviews at this time, so your full name would be published in the story.",0
"no one can diagnose me with PTSD because it is not! i don''t know if this is a OCD thing? if i have a multitude of things on my mind or other milder worries i seem to be fine but when my brain is quiet and worry-less it seems i involuntary remind myself of the ''dissociative flashback'' which starts a cycle of psychological drowning and feelings of detachment as well as depressive feelings. this is all because of one thing in the past, my life would be 100x better if this was gone heck i would DO anything to get rid of this forever! meds have helped it occur less frequently but it is still the same severity.",1
"This isn't the first time this has happened, even with my ex I used to put effort into creating funny and deep conversations and she'd make quite surface level replies, but I thought it was because she was severely depressed so I didn't mind making an effort with her. Am I missing something? She doesn't have many hobbies and works in a pub so I can't talk about her interests really as the only think she kinda likes is textiles and she doesn't do it anymore as she's so focused on her job. I should probably mention she's really really shy, which she has admitted to me. For example, when we meet in person, she's so nervous that she's physically shaking for about 15 minutes until she relaxes.",0
"Hi everyone,  Sorry to ask but today is my Mum’s birthday. This is the first month in ~6 where I haven’t been paid early, so until tomorrow I have no money. The issue is it’s my mum’s birth today, and she always wants a cake, but I am unable to give her one this year. A nice cake from my local supermarket is £10, and I will be paid by work tomorrow so I can repay you soon.",1
"I did something once that I had been doing almost constantly in the intervening years: I imagined my ex-fiancee. But this time, it felt real. ""Through the lord, all things are possible"" Shock, bliss, happiness, peace, closure, and many other emotions multiplied beyond reckoning coursed through me. I promised my life to God, and continue to believe that he did speak to me.",0
"I'm 35,husband 37 I always thought it would be ideal to have two kids.. My husband was on board with the idea hypothetically but now that it's actually the time to execute he is totally opposed to the idea His reasons are 1) He feels we can't afford it...He earns pretty well but I don't at the time. So we won't be able to actually build up a major college fund for her---- I feel that she can always take a loan later but she really can't loan a sibling.",0
"This time, the school is way bigger and there are so many rooms scattered around the school. Just worried that I won’t be able to find my class. How am I supposed to know where my room is? This school is so large. I’m not ready for this.",1
"I couldn't speak but finally managed to say, ""Bag, get my bag."" He was able to help me with my pills and touch me and talk to me enough that I came back. Now boyfriend is back to bed, and I'm assuming I'll be up for the rest of the night. I don't know what to do with this. This is scary stuff.",1
"But this time if she ordered me a shot, I gave it away. I'm one of the only friends left who will go out to eat or drink with her, and I don't want to do it anymore. I feel I am enabling her diseases and I feel extremely guilty. She is worrisomely thin, and I don't think she'll live another 5 years.

"Hey guys I have PTSD from years of emotional abuse and neglect by my narcissistic parents. I am living in their house again now due to some financial hardships (Im 22), I am constantly being triggered and am experiencing intensified symptoms.

"So long story short I’m currently a freshman and my mom has made it clear that I’m being kicked out before the start of my sophomore year. I plan on making my way to New York City and living on the streets while looking for a job under the table. I am hoping to find somebody willing to hire me for a construction//landscaping job. My goal is to save money while going to high school, so that I can get my diploma and start a career in law enforcement. Of course my mom didn’t think to take note to save anything such as my birth certificate or the like...",0
I seem to have these bouts of anxiety. I'm not constantly anxious but if something worries me enough there's a good chance I'll start on this downward spiral. When I get like this not only do I start worrying I get this terrible feeling. All I can describe it as is like a heavy dark feeling. It's very hard for me to shake it.,1
"I come out bleeding and it boy tried to yell at me. But he noticed my arm and was like "" oh my God"" but then crazyasses started to whine that he was losing his mind. So he went back downstairs. Shortly thereafter it boys parents kicked him out for violence towards the family, property damage, and refusing to get a job. Him and crazy ass started haranguing me about me getting them both jobs at my pwork which I didn't want to do honestly.",1
This is just a vent. Thanks to anyone who reads this. Wish me luck with this new lady. She is also a yoga instructor. Maybe she will be good.,0
"During one of our many discussions, she compared it to me playing with people on my friends list. I explained that usually we are in game friends and only really speak about the game. A few times she offered to talk about in game stuff only with her friends. The last time she offered, I accepted feeling that it would solve my issue. Once I accepted her offer, she backpedaled almost immediately during the same conversation.",0
"Best to work backwards. The first time I went in to an actual psychological professional to get them to weigh in on my condition was due to a flashback - The only one I've ever had and frankly pretty easy to deal with, which sets the tone for me. As far as the disorder goes, I got off pretty easy. Conversation to do with specific details of child abuse caused me to tap into a repressed memory of childhood abuse which I won't go into too much detail on in a public thread, though if anyone is interested in the context, I don't mind sharing over messaging. It was like when one imagines things under their own control - Conjuring images and sounds at will while still experiencing reality, but it wasn't under my control.",0
"one day i broke down into absolute tears and was rushed into the counselers office. at this point im in 8th grade and this is by no means acceptable behavior. we are about to go into high school and i just burst into a ball of tears in front of every last one of my peers. the good thing is, this scenario made me care a little less about what everyone thought of me due to the already absolute embarrassment of myself. My mindset, the people i surrounded myself with, and my family life were all fucked to say the least... especially family.",0

And again, mods, if this isn't appropriate, just let me know and/or point me to a better sub!",0
I just wanted to be believed. She said that she would talk to toe - A few days later she came back to me ( after her convo) and claimed that I was being emotionally abusive. That toe is important and that I'm overstepping my boundaries. I don't even know if its all in my head or not but I feel as though toe is just a nasty piece of work that I don't know what to do about it.,1

"I have completely given up hobbies and interests outside work. I do not have time to engage in them. Things that I could normally do to relax, like exercise or yoga, are absolutely out of the question because I work 16 hours a day. 3. I am frequently sleep deprived due to my work hours.",1
"I don't want a situation to come where she calls the police lying saying I hit her (anytime a domestic incident happens, it's automatically the guy's fault) She's called the police falsely on my dad twice, so I wouldn't put it passed her.

"I dated my ex-girlfriend for 6 years. She was madly in love with me for most of the relationship then had a falling out in the last year of the relationship where things turned ugly. I went through depression and hit a rough patch which also made me insecure which gave her the power in the relationship. I also put us both through some unnecessary times and abused the love and time she gave me, she tried really hard, I was too stubborn. Eventually near the end I was a bit vulnerable and she left.",0

"I struggle to know what it is I should do most of the time... during this anticipatory stage. If my anxiety oscillated between normal followed by panic, I wouldn’t feel so confused and constantly question what I should be doing right now. There aren’t any damn patterns. Further, It seems like most of the anxiety coping techniques (deep breathing, exercise, meditation, etc) are only effective at keeping the feelings at bay while you’re doing them. 30 minutes later you’re right back where you started.",1
"It wasn't a trap (like, wth?) and I just couldn't hide my emotions effectively. I know he has a lot on his mind lately and he's very anxious, but so do I, and I also feel it's unfair to him to use me as his emotional punching bag. I love the guy, but lately I've been thinking almost on daily basis whether to put an end to the relationship. I'm exhausted by his continuous lashing out and bullshit.",1
"Over the last 18 months we have become closer than ever and as best friends living separately have grown our life together. 8 years ago we were panhandling for gas money to get to work, and now we are for successful business owners. We have spoiled my daughter rotten. Designer clothes, designer makeup, way too much freedom, gym membership, and anything else a 14 year old girl could ever want. I think a lot of that comes from the fact that we were not able to provide her with anything for so long.",0
"I asked him what happened to his hand, and he told me that the hood of his car slammed down on it but he's fine. When we got home Jude pulled me to the side and told me Coop is not fine. He told me Coop can't move it at all and it's a problem. Coop doesn't like doctors. He looks at Doctors and Nurses like they're the Grimm Reaper or something.",0
"I hide my own set of keys. She tries to take her keys away from me and I refuse, which turns into a full-blown fight. I have marks and bruises all over my arms and back, as well as deep scratches from her fingernails. At one point, she had me on the floor, cornered on the steps, repeatedly slamming my head into the wall and shoving a loose key that fell off the keyring into my breast, still trying to get the rest of the car keys out of my hand. I'm not saying I didn't retaliate, but I only went to far as to push her away, never hitting her intentionally but more as an act of defense.",1
I especially appreciate stories of similar experiences and such. I hope everyone's have a nice day. TL;DR: I ended up with anxiety due to relationship and health anxiety and now I can't stop thinking about how I might some terminal illness (cancer) just because I feel some weird tingling or pain in an area I didn't before. Or even a cough can freak me out a little. If you also/used to suffer from this how do/did you deal with it?,1
"To make up for it I made a cute little note and I made him a batch of his favorite cookies. I was honestly so damn proud of the gift when I finished putting it together, it looked awesome! To add some context, I have attended a few games with him (and the rest of the family) and absolutely loved them. I didn’t care about the actual games themselves, but I loved being there with my family and the cool atmosphere and stuff. Well, apparently my dad didn’t think it was so awesome.",0
"I knew that he was scary when he would pray in front of me, yet the entire thing was an angry ATTACK on God (not trying to get into beliefs here, just what happened.) I knew he knew how wrong he was when he told me one day to not tell anyone but that he actually HAD threatened suicide in front of his ex wife with a knife, yet still painted her as the evil doer in the story. I knew he was lying when he made sure to tell me about how crazy one of his exes went at the end accusing him of rape (why would he even bring it up!!) and how after he took another ex home from injury while we were together, that she might try to lie to me and say that something happened, but NOTHING did! It gave me chills when this man would tell me if his ex wasn't his child's mother he would have had her murdered long ago, and that he had friends offer to help!",1

"And it makes me more anxious which causes me to slip up *more*. It's getting WORSE though. I thought I could hold it down, this has been an ongoing issue for about a year or so and it has never been this bad but lately it's getting to the point where I can't even talk to my own MOTHER without freaking out over this shit. She came back in town from a very long half year vacation recently and I had to go to dinner with her because that's what you're obligated to do and I had to sit there and try and make small talk with my brother the whole damn night looking anxious as fuck...

When I take the time to relax and think of something nice like a waterfall or a forest or something like that I then automatically think of how bad people are going to mess it up and pollute and make it worse and just be awful.

"How do I decide? I clicked with one guy, but he does talk therapy, doesn't really have a specific method like EMDR or CBT. There are many who use specific methods, and most didn't click, or had approaches I feel iffy about.

I'll talk to people about it in person, or other private way, any time. I wish I felt like I could be more open about it.

"My mom then hit me with the newspaper and it shocked me that she would do this, she knows I don't like play hitting, smacking, striking, hitting or violence of any sort on my person. Do I send out this vibe asking for it from the universe? Then yesterday I decided to take my friend to go help another ""friend"" move to a new place. While we were driving the friend we are moving strikes me on my shoulder. And I address it immediately because this is the 4th time I have told him not to do these things, then my other friend who is driving nearly gets into an collision with another car i think because he was high on marijuana and the friend we are moving in the backseat is like ""you have to understand I was just trying to get your attention"" you know the thing 5 year olds do to get peoples attention by smacking them, this guy is in his 60's.",1
"I feel alone, because I feel like people don't think ""I was having a panic attack"" as a legitimate excuse to miss something. I don't even feel like others with panic attacks 100% get it, because I don't really get that feeling of a heart attack or anything, I feel like my panic attacks are weird, and all the stuff I read about ways to help seem to be for people who get the heart attack feelings. I get a panic attack, and then get anxious about the panic attack, and it's just a big cycle. I try to open up to people, but they don't really understand. I just want to be normal.",1
"From the moment I wake up and until I go to sleep I don't feel safe. When I'm around other people I feel even even more anxious/fearful. I know nothing bad is going to happen to me, but I still feel this way.  I don't really have any friends, and these intense chronic feelings makes it seem impossible to make a real connection with anyone. That's what I need the most is some sort of real connection with another human being.",1
"When you go to bmv/dmv they require a physical as well as mailing address when getting ID or drivers license. For the physical address you can use something descriptive such as ""street name "" mile marker 3 or under bridge at Dawson/Racine. Where ever you ""live"". I never knew this until recently and now I try to tell every houseless person I meet just in case. They might look at you weird in the office when you tell them your address but oh well!",0
"I know I should tell her my doubts, because I know she's gone through doubts before as well. But I also don't know if now I'm just second guessing because I'm just generally concerned about the future. Above all I just have no idea what to do.   ---   **tl;dr**: living long distance, dealing with chronic wedding anxiety and fear about impact of children, fantasizing about others, and hoping for insight from people who have been through similar experiences.",1
Cut to yesterday... My parents booked me in for an emergency appointment with the DR because my anxiety and depression is so bad I cannot function day to day and spend most of my time stuck in bed panicking. I was prescribed 2mg Valium to go alongside my anti-depressants. I took one and within 15 minutes I went from SEVERE anxiety to COMPLETE calmness Well... here comes the paranoia associated with my bad cannabis trip years ago... I FREAKED.,1
"Through everything, I just froze and waited for it all to be over. Each time I petitioned her to stop, she would become very visible distressed. She spent a lot of time talking about suicide. During the school year, we exchanged letters every day at school that, in retrospect, sounded a lot like love letters from her part, but I chalked it up to a best friend love. I'd never been in a romantic relationship- I was 13 at that point, and didn't really know what that looked like anyway.",1
"Hi everyone, this is my story, what I've been able to take away from it, and the feelings and the hurt that have lingered, as well as questions. Warning, this is kind of a long post, but there is a lot I need to say and just get out of my head. Trigger and Content Warnings**:** Explicit mentions of sex acts with some details,mentions of coercion, mentions of being threatened, mentions of alcoholism. Things to know about me, for the context of my life and who I am: I am 24, I am queer, my pronouns are she/her, I am trans-gender woman (please Google if you are unfamiliar with the terms), I am autistic, and as a child I was home-schooled for a very long time and lived in the middle of nowhere farm country, with no buses, sidewalks, or means of transportation. When I was 13, I had just found out my father was diagnosed with early onset dementia and I was stricken, to say the least, knowing that my already dysfunctional family was about to go through the horrors of watching my father become less and less of himself.",1
"Anyway, he bullshited that her insurance wasn't covered  by anyone in this state, and that it was illegal for him to refuse her her shift. My SO had already talked to his HR head. They had previously decided that there wasn't much they could do unless she came up to him. Then tonight happened, the head of HR is severely worried for her safety (and my SOs) in a way he wasn't before. The head has called the Domestic Violence Hotline himself, and is looking for resources to help him solve this very delicate/tricky issue.",0
"I was having a fucking panic attack.Once we payed and where done, we went into the thrift store to tell my mom we where done. I finally told i was having a panic attack because he threatened to smack the crap out of me. ""he threatened you?"" i could tell by my tone she doesn't believe me. ""we're probably not coming here anymore"" she said.",1
" The title pretty much says it all but I want to add all the gory details. In my girlfriends family there are a lot of hammy downs. There is just a plethora of clothing and obscene amounts of things that nobody needs, so when I want a thing the answer is almost universally ""lets ask my mom first before buying"". In my life thus far I don't really take other peoples things. I have like 5 pairs of jeans and like 3 more pants I bought for work, but other than that I don't have extra stuff and I like it that way.",0
"I’m on lamictal, Zoloft, and we just added Wellbutrin. A liver test showed that I metabolize SSRIs slowly so I’m wondering if serotonin is building up in my system? I told my doctor about it and she just said these are classic symptoms of anxiety. I disagree. Has anybody felt this way or had an experience with serotonin being too high?",0
Child Sexual Abuse is a huge problem which needs ending. Children never build a true sense of self and emotions if someone takes it away from them. I don't want to be seen as a victim. I just want people to know I understand them and hope this will make them happier. Thank you for reading and have a good day,0
"I listen to him when he’s having a bad day and thinking about what I did to him. I listen and try to say silent when he yells and screams at me. I take his insults in stride, as best as I can, because I feel like I deserve it. He tells me that he “has no respect for me” and I am “nothing but a mistake” and he tells me that I am trash, I do not deserve anything that I have, and that I am just a waste of his time. He tells me that he hates me.",1
"However, because the other couple’s share comes out to just under what they owe me, my fiancé and I had planned to keep their share and forgive the rest of their debt. I tried to deposit the check, but since it has all four of our names on it, I was told all four of us have to be present. So I had to get in contact with them. Obviously they weren’t happy that I wanted to keep their share. The way they see it, because they paid the deposit in the first place, the money is theirs.",0
Today it all came to a head when no amount of uppers or downers was leveling me out. I had a meeting to run at 1. I had lunch with a customer at 12. I had a calls all morning...and you know what? I couldn't do it.,1
"4)/5) Couldn't count it. He loses sleep because he games until 2-3 AM regularly. I think 4 hours might be a low-end estimate, but I don't want to say he games EVERY day. He doesn't go out with ""real life"" friends, except if I invite him out with my friends. Numerically - yes, we spend time together, but about 12 of those hours are spent sleeping.",0
"And it only took me three doctors telling me this over the span of 10+ years for me to believe it. Given all the crazy symptoms I've had, and that I really trust and like my current doc, I'm willing to believe it. So here I am looking at a bottle of Escitalopram (5mg, Lexapro generic) thinking ""so... it's come to this"". I've always been a shy one, but I thought I could handle anxiety on my own. However, 3 years ago I hit a giant anxiety wall (not knowing that's what it was).",0
"I can’t stop sweating, the second I cough up phlegm there is immediately more and I’m like gagging on it, my nose is stuffed and I have to actively try to breathe, I feel so uncomfortable, I’m losing my mind. I’ve hit my breaking point and I’m just sobbing uncontrollably. I’m stressing because I’ve already had to use sick time at work this year and it’s only the first week, the house is covered in all of my sick germs and I don’t have the strength to disinfect it, the laundry is piling up and the house is messy. I probably sound like an absolute baby right now but I can’t do multiple days of being incapacitated. I feel like shit and can’t do anything I need to get done.",1
I don't know what to do with myself ! At times I feel like just killing myself. but I have been thinking that for a couple of years now so thats not happening. .  About a month ago I chose to go homeless because I was stuck.,1
"Had a good weekend, went to a movie together the 19th. Feb 22 she started full dose of Zoloft. Feb 23 weekend, we hung out again, but mostly stayed in because I was tired from traveling for work again. She seemed a bit more distant than I'd seen her but still content, and we had a good weekend together. Everything remained normal up til Feb 26 or so, regular texting, sexy texts, etc.",0
"My wife (we've been together 8 years) however is determined to 'finish the job'. Her father taught her much of what she knows and that is certainly a factor as to why she is an constructual engineer... But unlike her father she isn't a certified electrician or plumber nor is she especially skilled at carpentry. The issue is that we live 5 hours away and even if we did go *every* weekend to work on the house it would take well over a year to even get it into a acceptable state, let alone 'finished' and sellable. I brought up the idea of getting contractors to finish the house.",0
"Make sure to take the bus when it comes to WalMart the last time, about 7pm. 6) There is a Chick-Fil-""A"" next to Walmart where you can get hot food. You can buy Top Rommin at WalMart which sells for 10 cents per cup (yes...really) and you can use hot water to put in it, and it is ready to eat. 7)  How do you get ""out"" of that situation? I don't know.",0
"I have been an avid Redditor for 4 years but unfortunately don't have the 1000+ karma needed to post on r/Borrow. I would pay $1200 ($1000 + $200 interest) in return by August 24 or earlier. Although I will (hopefully) receiving my stipend by the 6th, I know for a fact I will be receiving my scholarships for fall semester/my first paycheck from my job at home on or before the 24th, so this is just an added safety net in case the stipend takes extra time to process. I'm willing to provide any lender with the relevant personal information in a private message, and will keep in contact as much as necessary until the money is paid back (PayPal woud be best, but I'm open to other options as long as they are available in this country).

"Hi everyone. Last month my daughter was delivered 11 weeks early and will be in the NICU for the next couple months. It's been a hard time, emotionally, physically, and financially. To help me deal with it all, I started journaling about our experiences and decided to turn them into mini zines (printable little comic books). I set up a patreon account, which allows you to pledge $1, $3, or $6 a month in return for rewards.",0
"No, that's not an exaggeration but I wish I was. While I was driving last Tuesday I got extremely lightheaded, sweaty, and then pulled over and vomited blood all over the interior of my car. After a few moments of wonder if 'this was it' and deciding 'it definitely wasn't it, not on a highway' I snapped by myself back to what life was left and drove to the next exit to find help. My SO has a great summary of why this ended up costing so much money, but it's a sequence of very unfortunate events. That's even before the fact that while I was intubated and unconscious someone lifted the bag of all my clothes wallet.",1
"I am alone, and I don't know what to do. At this time I'm most interested in any 'quick tips' that can be offered on how to manage feelings of violation, betrayal, humiliation, distress, anger at the abuser and all those who stood by, ignoring the damage she was inflicting, anger at those who have protected her at the expense of her victims, anger at my family for their mistreatment, and how they effectively set me up for future abuse. Dissociative symptoms are a significant problem at this time. Focusing on a movie, tv show, video game, book, even a short song can be impossible at times. The interest in 'quick tips' on how to manage those overwhelming emotions is an attempt to make it feasible to read a fre books I'm hoping might help (Pete walker's CPTSD and James Chu's Rebuilding shattered lives, MacKenzie's Psychopath free).",1
"Anytime I have a scheduled transaction towards my checking account, my wages are immediately garnished. However, last night was the real wake up call. After work, I came home drunk and let my stress get the best of me. I ended up getting in a fight with my gf about money, finances and utilities. Not wanting to face the pathetic reality that I have ""sugar momma"" for a girlfriend, I packed everything I own in my vehicle, parked it less than a mile away (incase I may have forgotten anything) and slept in it until the battery died.",1
"I'm not getting any resources from the VA and I'm not getting better. I'm 100%, war time, service connect disabled for PTSD. I've been kicked out of the MHICM Range program because ""I'm not making enough progress”—ie not magically getting better. Im currently doing ACT therapy but it's not helping and the VA here can't offer talk therapy so they referred me to the Vet Center. After about six months there, my therapist told me I was ""too depressed to help.""",1
"Every cent right now is going towards making sure I don't end up homeless (I've gotten forbearance on my car payment for the moment) and it's looking grim. **[I feel embarrassed asking for help, but here is my Amazon <url> I couldn't figure out how to share my Walmart list...

"Not a huge amount of weight, but it was a big deal for me. I was on the treadmill every night for 45 minutes. I was doing good. Now I can't be on the treadmill or I start feeling ill again. Anyway, after the garbage issue I ended up in the hospital again.",1
"Stage 4 would be perfect. I know that's self-destructive thinking; I know I'm supposed to be present, current, not wallowing in my pain and sorrow. I know I'm supposed to focus on healthy thinking and growth. I know that I'm supposed to find joy now, and I really do try. I'm not sure there's such a thing as joy absent my children; it may be a fool's errand.""",0
"Friends and loved ones (who don't have anxiety) keep telling me to relax and since it's such a busy place it's nothing personal and to not think it worry about it. Which I'm sure is 100% true but not matter how many times it's said anxiety never believes it. I start my next shift in 30 minutes and stating to freak out and have small panic attacks which haven't happened in a while. I've been so good about keeping my anxiety in control and not putting myself in anxious situations, and this job pushed that (being the public eye and fucking up is one my biggest triggers) but the pay and reputation of the company is widely known and it's one of the most wanted jobs in my town. Does anyone have any advice or maybe gone thru something similar and came out on top?",1
I just feel kinda gross because I was giving her fucking college advice and stuff. I'm fucking furious. My clearest memory of my dad in highschool is him ramming my head repeatedly into a wall because I didn't want to pick engineering as a *second choice*. And NOW he chooses to support and help this fucking girl through college when I had to do all that on my own? He even skipped out on my graduation!,1
"I know this goes a bit beyond /r/relationships, but I'm also asking for advice on how to deal with this as far as our relationship is concerned. What do I do?   ---   **tl;dr**: Girlfriend's violent, crazy ex-fiance is out of jail after beating up his grandparents, and I don't feel safe. What do I do?",1
"Later that night someone snuck into the building we were sleeping in and killed Daniel.. he was chopped up with what I presume was a hatchet. I don't know why they spared me or Jay to this fucking day but I'd gladly take Daniel's place, he was the sweetest boy I ever knew. We were heartbroken and I vowed that I would find the bastard and get revenge for Daniel. I'm crying as I am typing this part because this is what fucked me up the most. Chapter seven: adopted",1
I got upset and called the dogs in and closed the door. When he came in he avoided me at first and when I confronted him about lying and sneaking around he defended it by saying it's my fault that I'm not okay with it. I've never been okay with it and i feel like I've been lead on throughout this entire relationship. The fact that he would prioritizing getting high over comforting me really hurts my feelings. I'm tired of feeling like a plant is more important then me.,1
"And I found as I got older, I always turned to women for support. My first marriage didn't work out, but I tried. And my second has been beautiful, we've been together for nearly 18 years, married for 16. We still have a lot of fun and while she doesn't understand what we went through first hand, she's perfectly supported me and we've built a good life together. My mum never had another relationship.",0
"I won't defend myself, I know I shouldn't have raised my voice and I should have left much much earlier. I know who I am. That said.. Every day, I see a look that tells me a person I know loathes me. A thin veneer of social platitudes to cover a roiling hatred. I don't know what to write past this point.",1
"So I texted her a message saying “7:45” , I sent it with the quotations to let her know that she’s late and I’m starving. So F2 responds to me through her phone, by voice message. She gave me a very sassy attitude telling me to “remove the pipe from my ass and eat a snack”. I had already needed to eat a snack since they made me wait a half an hour, I don’t think that her response was warranted for what I said. I get what I said was a little petty but I don’t think I deserved that attitude.",1
"I developed some health problems with my stomach around September of last year and had to be hospitalized, had very high wbc, did a cat scan and so on. They let me go with some antibiotics and no answer about what was wrong with me. This, I guess, left me feeling very nervous, the next time I was researching my pains and such and blah blah everything online telling me I’m going to die. So I turn off my phone and I’m lying there trying to sleep when i get this sudden gasping feeling and like I can’t breathe. I feel completely overwhelmed by it, my face and hands feel numb, I wake up my family and we wait maybe an hour before taking me to the hospital.",1
"I live in a different country than where I'm from and I feel like all my actual friends are back home and that I have very few good friends in this country that I can talk to and who want to spend time with me. I just suddenly don't really know what to do with myself or what I want. Like I'm kinda stuck and going nowhere and I hate feeling so insignificant. I don't know, maybe I'm making a big deal for nothing and my anxiety is getting to me. I have CBT tomorrow so I know I'll have a chance to talk about it there but I just feel so hopeless today and didn't know where else to turn but to reddit.",1
"I really suck at explaining things so if you have any questions please ask. UPDATE: I gave my casual partner a vague warning about the future and how, if the time comes, I'll need to make the decision for myself. tl;dr I am stuck in a love triangle with a casual DDLG relationship on one side and sharing of mutual feelings on the other. Multiple things keep the DDLG from relationship from being public and I hate sneaking around. I want to have an open relationship with the other girl.",1
"I will browse a book on a subject that I want or need to study, research it, think about how it's going to be, then when the time for studying comes, I'm thinking about something else. Sometimes I spend the day thinking about that hardcore workout I'm gong to do in the evening, and then I spend the whole workout session thinking about something else. Sometimes even when I'm talking to people I like I realize my mind will wander. Does anyone feel these things? Do you think it's related to anxiety, or do I have ADHD or something else?",1

"In the dream, he kept telling me to do it as he cut himself deeper and deeper in his arm. Then he said I’m gonna do it, all because of you too. You deserve to die, then at the end of the dream he kept holding me down to put a knife against my throat and said this is how it ends, just do it yourself.” I am also looking into talking to someone I can somewhat relate to on this, talking to your friends about this typically doesn’t help me. Thank you for listening.",0
"I don't know. Pretty sure. But my nose is stuffy from this stupid cold so it'd make sense that I'm having a hard time breathing from it. But I'm also having a hard time breathing through my mouth. I can't find my vapor rub anywhere, which is annoying the crap out of me because I feel like it'd help a little (the mintiness from brushing my teeth helped a tiny bit).",0
"They've done a lot that's cut down my self-esteem and such, but they've also done a lot for me too. I have a home, I'm well-fed, I have my own possessions, I have a car, and I have some wonderful memories with them. When I was molested, they came to my rescue and constantly stood up for me when nobody else believed me. Sometimes they're the most amazing parents I can ask for, and other times I'm afraid of them. My mother isn't that bad, but my father is the worst.",0

"The idea of what ISPs can do once the lack rules are truly active have made me feel sick to my stomach. I can't sleep and it is affecting my school life. I can't afford to pay ransom to the Corporate Fascist Thugs who wish to cableize the internet and I can't stand the idea of the internet becoming like that of China and North Korea. We are still fighting, but I'm still paranoid and every day that gets closer to April 23rd makes me feel more infuriated and panicky. I feel under attack and very life about to be destroyed.",1
"Anything from elbowing someone in the face to completely letting loose with a knife or a baseball bat. It can be mildly amusing for a moment, but I find it actually calls up a distress response more than anything else. I start to feel my head ache, my shoulderblades become taut and sore, and my throat close. My heart rate also increases and my breathing becomes somewhat more laboured. I know this is unhealthy, and I will be addressing it with my therapist, however I was hoping to  get some input from fellow reddit users with PTSD.",1
"I’m  asking yall how can I live life properly? Immediately after I threw up  in year 2, I never feared it happening again.

But now, nausea? Stop eating for the day.",0
"I can't afford to buy new clothing, not even from goodwill. Right now, I've currently got two pairs of workout capris and that's it. And in the northeastern us it is getting colder.

"Hey guys and girls. I've been going through a lot the past couple of years and was looking to maybe get some advice, or just find some people who can relate because I don't have that in my day to day life.

But three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip. He is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom. The hospice nurses (oddly the same ones who saw my mom out) have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad doesn't want to leave his side.

"And it's like that all the time when similar experiences occur. Now this probably has connections to the social anxiety and depression I suffer from (heck I'm feeling anxious rn as I type this) but it's so weird. I mean I guess it kinda makes sense if I'm so insecure, right? Does anyone else suffer from similar forms of anxiety or sort of related? Interested to know.",1
The violence was still happening. The mind games were also still happening so I felt like it was my fault. That I had done something wrong to “deserve” it. I supported both him and myself in this new state while he was in school. I ended up losing my job for reasons out of my control and had a really difficult time finding a new job.,1

“Take all your problems and rip ‘em apart... carry them off in a shopping cart... one thing you should’ve known from the start... **your problems in hand are lighter than at heart. **” The things that seperate us from taxonomically lower lifeforms are our abilities to record and rationalize information.

"So many local counties and cities struggle with homelessness and put a lot of resources into fixing the problem. But I feel society as a whole needs to change in order to truly fix the problems at hand especially at the federal level. By at least having these conversations, we can start talking about how we as a nation might be able to change to help our neighbors. I hope this made a bit of sense. I have been up late and wanted to reflect on some of the previous conversations I have had with people trying to change the narrative on homelessness.",0
"This leads to me not liking the general mood in the classroom which leads to me being un-motivated and demoralised when I'm at school. Every day I try to see if I can pretend to be sick to avoid going to school because I find almost no joy at school which is a shame, because of all the schools I have been to over the years, i actually enjoy what we do and the teachers are nice. I have no idea why this simple fact is affecting me so much. But I just feel horrible whenever I think about school or the thought of having to go to school. TL;DR: I spent a lot of time with my friends during break, and I'm depressed because I have to go back to school with classmates that are very immature.",1
"The next day after a meeting he tried confronting her about being ignored. To other people it’s nothing, however to me, I can’t stand the thought of her being assaulted or harassed in that way. I think he might be working later today when she’s working. We both discussed that she would “tell him to stop and that she has a boyfriend and if he doesn’t stop she’ll tell the manager” which I’m okay with. Except all I want to do is protect her, part of me knows that she’s going to be okay, but I need some advice about how I should address the issue if this guy doesn’t stop, keep in mind the fact that I can wrestle and basically fight, and can someone tell me something that will help me hold onto the hope?",1

Drunk driving, attempting to detain me in one place so he could continue to yell at me, child endangerment, stalking, physical and sexual abuse, cheated on me multiple times, (including one instance I am sure was actually rape). I kicked him out months ago and filed for divorce as soon as I was able after that. Now I have a court date for the restraining order for me and my son, which I finally gathered up the courage (and the witness testimony) to file. I know that everything I've said is true, and I'm confident that my evidence is strong.",1
"I'm going to try not to sound too sad or victimized, but I'm just sad. I grew up fairly disadvantaged compared to my friends. I've been poor since I was born, never had enough to eat, was abused by my dad, have raised my sister, support my family, work almost constantly, and make money on the side. In addition, I've been consistently abused since I was 8 years old, the same age I met my best friend. She's much wealthier than I am.",0

"So in the past two weeks, I’ve been supporting my dad through some mental health things, I’ve been having trouble at work, my Nanna got diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, and to top it off, my boyfriend broke up with me two days ago.I work full time and I’m also at uni, which I’m falling behind in. Whatever I do, I cannot concentrate on anything and just fall into an absolute panic when I have a second to think. I feel so nauseous that I can’t eat. And I’m bursting into tears randomly. Can you suggest some coping strategies that you use to stop the constant cycle of negative thoughts?",1
its been 9 months now for our marriage and she managed to sleep with me with lights off as i cant even think of sleeping with lights on. now she is pregnant and its 8 months. now she wants to keep lights on in the room which i cant sleep with lights. what should i do ? is that behavior of my wife normal ?,1
"Quite frankly, him being so nonchalant about the whole thing kind of baffles me. Does he just trust her that much? Or is it me he trusts? His reaction (or lack of one) kept on making me think I was overreacting and reading too much into things. I could see that Fred certainly thought it was messed up, even half conscious.",0
"And I’m at a complete loss as to how we resolve this. (BTW, we have talked about all of this about 1,957 times already. There is nothing written here he hasn’t heard before.) TL;DR – Husband has always been the primary earner with well-paying jobs, but has experienced serious burn-out. As we’re eating into our savings, it looks like I’ll have to put my business on hold and go back to work.",1
"That was about 7 hours ago. Normally, I do not get much effect from tea because I only ever drink half a cup as I don't like it that much. However, I have been feeling jittery all day and my heart periodically feels as though it is racing. I have that adrenalized and uneasy feeling that I always get with caffeine. It wasn't really bothering me because I knew it was probably from the caffeine.",1
"Jimmy laughed and chit chatted as if nothing was the matter which was normal for Jimmy even under heavy fire he’d still be nattering in his Scottish accent with a smile under that giant twisty RAF moustache.

Jimmy was a bit surprised. “Steady on old chap, I just need a tinkle.”",0
"But what should I say? Part of me wants to tell her I'm sorry for being a shit boyfriend at the start and that as I've gotten older I've gotten wiser and more experience. But would she even care about that shit? Or should I just start off with ""Hey, haven't seen you in awhile, hows everything"" and start from there? Ugh, maybe I'm overthinking this... Anyways would really appreciate you guys or gals out there with more experience than me guiding me through this minor plight I put myself in.",1

I'm not perfect today but I really see the light at the end of the tunnel. I look forward to my future.",0
"Can't put this under my true account, but I'm feeling horrible – I just completely screwed up a job application for a position I really wanted. Part of me is like ""oh well not meant to be"", but SERIOUSLY, the application was meticulous. My email? Nope – my computer crashed, I restarted with a draft email which I (stupidly) assumed had saved in the correct way. It hadn't.",1
"I am obviously devastated. I feel disappointed, angry, sad and rejected. I'm constantly asking myself why she no longer wants to live with me. She says she wants to have her own space to go to when she wants to be at ease, ""not that she doesn't feel at ease with me, it's just different"". I tried to make her see that we're supposed to make a new home for ourselves where we will both feel at ease, but to no avail.",1

We had only been doing long distance for 3-ish months, which is not long at all, but we had been dating before that for roughly 3 years, with a short break in between. I'm taking a gap year so I've been bouncing from place to place & my parents are so protective that they don't let me visit friends at college often (especially not her since they are suspicious of our relationship anyway [homophobia lol]). I did visit her once, but only for a few days and she visited me in return. Anyway, we both couldn't commit to a strict schedule of meeting up because of school, parents, money...",0

Exercise has helped in the past with my anxiety but since I have been having my recent dealings of anxiety I have been finding it harder to get active. A triggering factor of my anxiety over the last few weeks has been an increased heart rate. Sometimes if I stand up too fast/run up the stairs my heart starts pounding and then my mind spirals into the fear of a heart attack and my heart beat just keeps increasing till the point of anxiety. I have been taking walks and my heart rate would increase (naturally) and I would get the fear and my fears would multiple till the point when I would be close to a panic attack. I would like to start riding my bike again or working out in general but I am afraid of:,1

Everyone in my family is pretty jumpy (I'm pretty sure we all have high anxiety), but lately I have become ridiculously easy to startle! The first time I noticed it being extremely bad was while at my boyfriend's and he was cooking steak. As occasionally happens, the smoke detector went off because of the steaks.",0

It's really triggering a sense memory i have, so instead of remembering the event, it feels like it's happening right now. It is the most devastating ending to this day that could have possibly happened. I was feeling so brave lately. Does anyone else get sense memories?",1
"She used to make me lie in bed with her when my stepdad was gone for the night and she would rub my hair and my ears. When I was a teenager and in my early twenties, I got so angry when people would touch my head or ears. She would make me sit in the front seat and hold her hand while we were driving. She said it made our relationship stronger. She told me that when I was born, I gave her the best orgasm of her life.",0
"He would tell me it was the best university in the world(a white lie) and how great it was. I didn't want to go there. I didn't aid in the application process at all. He did everything. He wanted me to go there because it was cheap, and he assumed that if it were otherwise either i would just do nothing or spend a lot more money on school than he'd like.",0
"She never disclosed any of this to me, and probably never would have if the embassy hadn't discovered it first. In her words, she was afraid I would lose all interest in her if I found out she was married before. Truth be told, I likely would have, as I was still young when we first met. She claims she left that husband because of the abuse she received from him and his relatives ((still lived with his parents)). I was crushed at that time, as we had only been married for about a month.",0
"He also said that Brian's mother made comments like she hopes she gets hit by a bus and she's so depressed because I'm doing this to her. (No mention has ever been made by them how much our daughter is having to miss out on by having this medical issue let alone what their own son is being put through from their lack of respect.) The other problem is, I genuinely believe Brian's father wants a relationship with our daughter. The fact that we're withholding her from their toxic behavior right now might be a turning point for him to grow a pair in his own marriage. I'm not holding my breath, but I have a little bit of hope.",0
"I'm having a rough time right now and going through some things where my anxiety and depression keep dragging me down. My roommates have not really experienced someone with anxiety before really.

"Thing is, after we broke up we had sex a few times in August and September and as far as I'm aware she has slept with at least one other guy in this period too. The real question is what do i do now? I want to tell the guy about this, and wish someone would've done the same to me 2 years ago.

"You have mental noise: These are thoughts that arise spontaneously and we have no control over. For some people these are very negative. Behind this mental noise we have the observer however, this is you. When you are engaged in a activity that creates flow, your mental noise is reduced, and the observer has complete control.

I realize there's something crazy privileged about the whole thing (parents want me to spend more money? i should xpost to r/firstworldproblems!) If this really is an absurd thing to worry about, sorry for making you read through this thesis but please do let me know because I'm just really confused and sad.

"That is a waste of energy. I know and have lived your combative relationship with both your parents. First, it is your dad, then you go to your mom, then it is your mom and you go to your dad...... you are playing them and that is very manipulative.

"I don't have PTSD, I know how debilitating it is for you guys who do, but I thought I'd post in here because you might be aware of the symptoms and see if there's any connection? Basically I used to be severely bullied back in school and I've never gotten over it. I have nightmares, and even like ""day-mares"", where something somebody does or says makes me remember something that happened, suddenly, and it makes me lose all concentration as I just stare into space remembering the event. Sometimes they're recurring, sometimes they pop out of some dark corner of my mind, where all the oppressed memories are. I've never fully recovered, and I've only recently got to a place where nobody takes the piss out of me for some reason or another.",1
"I went to the ER recently because it reached 100 bpm and wouldn’t go down but in retrospect it’s because I was reinforcing my anxiety by numbers high, it won’t go down, oh shit number’s higher and it won’t go down. Repeat. I turned off heart rate tracking and fitness tracking. It’s a shame because I feel it’s turning off a valuable part of the device but quantifiable health data has become one of my triggers. If x to x+5 is a healthy range I freak at x+6 etc.",1

"I wanted to plant a new chapter in my new city, but haven't had time to devote to making it happen yet. I feel like I was the only one taking it seriously and it's dying a slow death. My problem is that one of the acquaintances is giving me a lot of power play-type problems. For example, I'll request *four times* in three different mediums we use, to email contributions to an end-of-year favorites list and rather than do that, she put hers on a share drive and told others to do the same in spite of my multiple requests to email me instead for better ease of sharing. Emails are met with snarky responses or half-measures which mean I still have to chase down.",1
"I began to see a therapist and started taking some medication for my mood. I was really trying to improve myself. The first medication I tried, I now believe, made things like social anxiety worse. I recently found a medication (Zoloft) that has changed my life. I had been exercising, going out of my way to connect with old friends who I like in an effort to curb the isolation etc.",0
"It's not a black nd white situation, I panicked, argued and a bunch over this with them, admittedly not helping my case, but I'm over that. I want help for my issues.  Enough sobbing, I sometimes feel so hopeless, but I need to remember that while I am down, I am not out. Employment, temporary housing, even just basic street smarts, I'd like to know how to cope with this situation. What to do, first 100 days and all.",1
She loves being drowned in kisses and whisked off to bed like a princess. No all she can manage is side hugs. This is also taking a toll on me (not being able to fall asleep/wake up next to the woman of my dreams is crushing) but I'm trying with all of my heart to be sympathetic. To get to my question: does ANYBODY have any advice to help her get through this? Anything I can do or say to help her feel comfortable again?,0

"It's really just standard-issue big corporation stuff. My direct manager slaps together the scheduling for our dept. at the last minute because she's overworked, and she's overworked because it's cheaper to make her do enough work for 2/3 people than to just open up an assistant position. I'm not getting enough sleep. I'm going off my medication because I can't make the appointments I need; my weekly schedule is a complete dice roll.",1
"Worse than that develop the same anxiety disorder. Again another reason to finish the relationship. I really love her but cannot and WILL NOT embarrass her like I did at the wedding. My plan is to go talk to a private physiatrist and see what they think. I don’t believe medication is the only answer but if it helps in conjunction with therapy, a healthy lifestyle and meditation then I will try it.",1

"It's important to put your needs first sometimes. This might sound really obvious but I never realized just how harmful it can be to try and please everyone all the time. Whether you speak your mind or don't, there's always going to be someone who dislikes you. I think it's important to realize that there's VALUE in your personal expression, so it's worth the risk of offending a few people. I just haven't been able to see the value in my own words for so long.",0
"Alright, I'll try to keep this as short as possible. **Some Background:** I have a co-worker we'll call Pamela. Pamela is disabled from complications and defects from when she was born; she has a brain shunt, and some cognitive issues. However, it's not enough to impair her too greatly obviously because she has worked in the call center I work at for about 12 years or so, and in other call centers before this. She receives accommodations for a disability at work though, such as having to meet less strict stats (like time per phone call, or time spent working offline) and being allowed to take a ""rest"" break if her disability causes her issues.",0
With my daughter recovering and my wife getting further in her diagnosis and her pregnancy I haven’t been able to catch up and it’s snowballing out of control. We applied for social security for both my wife and daughter but our paperwork was “lost in the system”.     I went to court last week and the writ of possession will be filed tomorrow morning to have my belongings removed from the home. I have asked for loans and co-signers but nobody close to the family is willing to take a hit to their credit. I have sought out rental assistance from local charities but they will only help me if I got the balance down to $500.,1
Last night one firmed and I were texting about something unrelated and B was brought up. I basically told her that I have distanced myself from B because of XYZ. She said she understands but B has been really nice lately and has been supportive of her pregnancy and has bought the baby tons of stuff... I don’t know why but I feel weird about that conversation. I even told her that I refrained from telling anyone for so long bc I don’t want anyone to view her differently.,0
"Lately I have started having some unusual episodes. \### Introduction I  have never had flashbacks as far as I know, but I was always upset every time somebody unexpectedly grabbed me, or worse, inflicted me some pain,  even if accidentally. If I saw that coming, than OK, but if not, I was  instantly teleported to a very bad place, emotionally. I was not  experiencing something I could call flashbacks, but there sure were very dark, painful and overwhelming feelings.",1
"There is so much I can't do because I don't drive and it has impacted my life in such a way that it feels like I am in my own personal prison. I have been to therapy but it doesn't seem to work. So I am asking, have any of you overcome this situation? How did you do it? Any advice?",1
"I really don’t know what to do about this, and I’m wondering if I’m even able to get over this fear. A traumatic experience compounded it in me as a kid, and I’ve been experiencing it for so long that it feels like second nature. It’s lkkely so ingrained with me that therapy won’t do much good. I need some help. If anyone can offer some, feel free.",1
"But it seems like I'm also dealing with abandonment issues with my parents which has recently reemerged after coming out as transgender which they don't support. Unfortunately, I have Lyme disease and live with them because I'm too sick to do anything and they won't support my transition. I get the feeling that if I was healthy and I transitioned I'd never speak to them. I was reminded of PTSD from a comment on r/raisedbynarcissists/ and Borderline Personality Disorder was brought up. I don't know if it's a secondary condition or overlapping symptoms, but C-PTSD specifically was mentioned and that seems pretty accurate.",1

Before today I don't think I saw her for about a week which is crazy considering how close we were and that we live under the same roof.",1
"At some point in the past year, we discussed living together. She seemed to be okay with it and never had any objections. Since both our rental agreements will soon expire (hers in May and mine in July), I started looking for a new place online.

I want to be an ambassador and she wants to go into marketing. Every day we spend time together, there isn't a moment where the two of us don't end up talking about our future. To be more specific, we always end up talking extensively about marriage, what to name our daughter, how many golden retrievers to get and the like. Don't get me wrong, I love her to bits and I enjoy talking to her about these things, it's just that I'm slightly worried that maybe she is in love with the idea of me, and I with the idea of her.",0

With work I get emails about updates to projects and I usually these days don't reply, and submit what I have worked on minutes prior to my meetings. Which always results in a pissed off boss really.

Everyday seemed overwhelming, and I slowly started dreading my patient appointments and sometimes rushed through them because I could sense a panic attack coming on. To make matters worse, my supervisor is not the most understanding person. English is not her first language, and it's sometimes very hard to communicate with her in person or in email.

I definitely do have a skill set learned from my time in therapy that I feel I can rely on right now, but if I get worse I am not sure if just that is enough...though hopeful I will not get worse.

However there is one topic he *won't* hash out with me, and that's that sometimes he asks me questions out of no where that to me feel kind of like little ""pop quizzes"" that I feel are designed to try to catch me off guard and stump me.

It made me stronger, as facing fear and trauma can do. But I also internalized a sense of profoud fear and vulnerability.",1
I’ve been sleeping in my car for 37 months with only 4 more months until I’m back on my feet. I’ve been staying in the same parking spot in the dark edge of a public parking lot every night. Last Thursday night I’m woken up by a cop banging on my window with his flashlight at 1:45am. He said he helped someone in the same parking lot a week prior find a place to live. I call bullshit on that.,1
"I’d decided to include them because they can either be used or not, but would be interested to hear people's thoughts. I’ll be going out this weekend to pass them out, there are unfortunately quite a few people sleeping on our high street so I had planned to give them to the first four people I came across. I assume it would be best to just say “Hi” and explain what’s in the bag and take it from there? I imagine people on the streets get a lot of abuse so I’m a bit worried about approaching someone in case they think I’m a twat. Also if someone is asleep, I assume it would be best to just leave a bag for them rather than wake them up to see if they wanted it?",0
"Hey everyone! I'm doing an article for a Mental Health Blog and I really want to write about people's stories on the importance on opening up/going to seek help from a professional. I would love to hear your experiences, why you went/started opening up, what you have learned, and how it has impacted your life! Of course everything you write will be anonymous on my post (I can even give you a pseudo name if you would like, just let me know)! Feel free to comment down below or message me if you want to be more private, thanks!",0
"I can't afford a treadmill and I'm not a big fan of gyms (plus there's none really nearby), so I'm trying to use really the one option available: going outside. This is a real problem for me and my anxiety. I feel like a gasping hippopotamus when I try running and am too embarrassed to let anyone see me like that, so every time I see a car or person, I stop running and immediately go back home. I try going outside late at night and early in the morning so I can run, but there are like always people around and it drives me insane. I don't know how to maintain the motivation to be active while dealing with my anxiety that keeps convincing me that everyone is judging me and may yell insults at me or the other side of things: may kidnap, attack or murder me (since I go out when it's pitch black outside to reduce the ability to see me).",1
"If you withhold financial information from this type of abuser, they will get it out of you somehow. Trust me. It isn't pretty. I withheld my credit card numbers for a year, and I paid every day for it. Anyway, I'm totally ranting at this point, but it was seriously amazing to find one person in this entire world who actually confirmed that what I experienced in trying to access help was real.",0
The next time I went to see her after that she said sorry if I wasn’t my self last time and I just said that she seemed tired and so I started to see her earlier in the day. Even from the first few time I went to see her she would always talk about herself. I didn’t have a problem with it because I am shy and so bad at conversation it kind of took the spot light off of me even tho that’s kinda what I was there to see her for. Also from the beginning she was kinda well very unprofessional and I knew this. I had just started to see a psychiatrist and I had told her what medications weren’t working for me so she gave me some of hers to try and see if they worked.,0
I want that. I want him as well as a SO but maybe I need more time. Its not fair to him. Maybe I'm more invested than even he is. I don't know,0
"When I was living with people I would stand behind the door and wait for it to be quiet before I step out of my room. It makes me so anxious to have to talk to people. It didn’t help that one of them would play loud music all day so I would put in my headphones and go to sleep until he has stopped. I was so anxious and depressed that semester, it really affected my grades. Anyway, today was my first time seeing someone for help about my anxiety and I did not know what to expect at all.",1
"I realized how small nuances subconsciously give me thoughts without me feeding into it. They feed into itself and I watch it do it all on its own, and it causes responses in my body and anxiety without trying. It's almost as is if another person is living in here but what it is, it's all instinctual. The awareness has given me a better grasp on things but it feels like an illness now with this new perspective because it comes over me like one. It's like being drugged and having no control over the effects, and you have no choice but to let it occur, and you fight any urges it gives you, although you may be aware of it happening.",1
"Good news is that my application for public housing was accepted. Bad news is that it will take up to six months for anything to open up for me. More bad news is that I didn’t know until today that my friend had to report me living with her to her landlady as soon as possible, and because she waited so long I am an unauthorized guest. So I have to be out today. I think I have a place to go, but I just feel like I’ve sort of hit a wall.",1
"I have started working on a youtube series about coping with and healing PTSD using movement therapy to find flow (hooping is my outlet).

"I [F18] have been with one guy [M21] for 3 years and within the last 4-5 months I’ve wanted to change our relationship dynamic from serious to casual. I still think I love him, but I find myself thinking about other people more and part of myself wants to see if I can do better. We get along great but I’ve always felt that our relationship has lacked an emotional aspect on his part. Part of the reason I want to end it also has to do with our financial situation - we’re both broke but I want to start working more to save more money because I’m trying to be more financially independent. I feel like he is somehow holding me back from my personal goals.",1
"I tried to break up with him at the end of the semester the day he was supposed to leave but he intentionally missed his flight to stay talking to me and talk me into staying with him. I don't know what to do. Mostly, I am scared that I will deal some kind of huge blow to his mental health and am just very scared of the repurcussions. I have friends apart from him I feel like I can fall back on, but I feel like a monster for confirming his fear of abandonment. I also feel conflicted because he is incredibly kind and generous and affectionate",1
"Am I wrong to be pissed about this? Was he really just being nice to her or is he just biding his time until they live closer?   ---   **tl;dr**: My boyfriend said ""you never know what the future holds"" when talking to a former fling. He says he was just being nice.",1

"When it's abuse in the workplace, it seems like everyone just says, ""Oh, get over it, and don't be a baby. There's nothing wrong with you."" I actually had one women tell me that my husband's behavior was 'completely normal' and that 'everyone acts like that' (I was floored. I don't know one other person who goes through shit like this at work or who acts like that - WTF?). They just want to brush it off, and no one gives a shit.",1
"I thought they’d give me another date to come back or put me on probation but that did not happen. They told me I wouldn’t be allowed back to my house until my court date in a MONTH. And even that is certain. Well I found a friend that I can stay with for another 2 days but after that I’m unsure of what to do. I’m currently unemployed don’t even have a license, there’s literally no one I can stay with my parents are refusing to talk to me.",1
"My daughter's father I was with for 5 years on and off. He was not abusive the first year, however when he became so I left and found out two weeks later I was pregnant. Of course he begged and pleaded for a second chance, and I believed that my daughter deserved me to at least give it a shot. I came back and surprise surprise it was worse than it ever was. I stuck it out until he disappeared for the eleventeenth time on a drunken bender, I checked my Facebook to find some scumbag girl who was dating one of his best friends was posting horrific, nasty, way out shit about me.",1
"This weekend she had a breakdown and gave me the following reasons:  - I'm almost a momma's boy  - My mom shares an unhealthy relationship with her children (my mom has admittedly told my gf a number of times that she makes her jealous and I care for another woman, but that's because my mom doesn't have a life outside our family and is understandable. My mom however cares for my gf, buys her presents, keeps in mind her allergies and cooks her food that she'd eat, so I don't get why my gf would have an issue)  - Apparently it's weird that I spend all my time and don't like to hang out with friends",0
"But I'm not physically attracted to him. Normally personality does a lot for me. I've met guys who I didn't feel attracted to and then started to really like because of their personalities (and vice versa). I go through days where I skype this guy and like the idea of him and feel like I can be physically attracted to him, but there are other days I don't feel anything physically. We are very long distance at the moment, so we've haven't had any face to face in person time for the past month (he's moving in 5 months).",0
"Generally good marriage. We can both be stubborn, so compromise doesn't come easy (especially for DW, who is very religious - I am not). We are at an uncomfortable stalemate. She comes from a family with 5 kids, I have only one other sibling. She feels there is a ""hole"" in our family and that 5 kids is the perfect number.",0
"I dwell on negativity quite easily and am I easily impressionable to brooding. I tend to express myself intensely to people without realizing it, giving the wrong impression because it's natural for me to be intense, but I am also quite composed and can for the most part be 'chill' but it's just that I only have two parts to me, a 'chill' way of expressing myself, and a passionate/intense way of expressing myself, so I come off the wrong way without realizing it when I think I'm being normal. People say that I'm a great person and easily liked but I don't realize sometimes how my expression and tone may come off, and people naturally give me a benefit of a doubt that I'm just passionate. My jealousy is extreme, and it causes me to be a questioning type but I use subtle ways to get information so it appears as normal a  question because I have attachment issues and fear of loss. There is more to explain but I got to the bare bottom of the issue after realizing these habits.",0
"He became depressed and gained a lot of weight, which makes him even more insecure about his looks. He also dropped out of university but now has come back to finish his degree. About me, I’m 21 years old, already graduated from college and now working a part time job but my goal is to become a flight attendant. I’m 162cm tall and weight 49kg, so I think it’s safe to say that I look fit. I also have a good looking face, I’m quite popular at my workplace among my coworkers and customers.",0
"Hello! I've found myself in between a rock and a hard place: the project I was working on lasted longer than I expected, and I've run out of money. I've been applying for local (Arizona) jobs, but most won't get back to me until after October 1st, which is my doomsday. I need 650 for rent. If I can't get it, it's over, which is frustrating and scary!",1
I know it is a huge accomplishment that I've been able to get back on the road and try again. It's just frustrating that I haven't been making as much progress as I'd like. I really miss being independent and free. Does anyone have any tips? I'd love to find someone that can relate or who has overcome this fear.,0
"I feel like a complete and utter fuck up. And it just fucking hurts. I’m filled with what if’s. “What if you didn’t ever use pot and was that what made you feel physically ill?” “What if it wasn’t that, but just high anxiety?” “What if I pushed through and got the job and things turned out well? How happy would you be compared to where you are now?” (I should mention I am not at a great place in my life right now in many ways, including employment).",1
But the days leading up to the test were the worst. I couldn't sleep 2 nights in a row and had to call in sick to work. I had a near panic attack and was unable to eat much as i felt like throwing up. Before the test my hands were shaking and my heart was racing. I was really not in a state to drive.,1
"She then said to me ""Am I not worth the effort because you don't want to fix this?"" after I told her I did not want to see her. There is plenty of other passive aggressive stuff that she says, but right now I'm so blinded by my disbelief I can't even tell if she is just being emotional or manipulative. What bothers me is this behavior happens every time we have gotten into a fight and then I have to apologize and make it right. tl;dr: Got into a fight with gf of 2 years since highschool - I've hit my breaking point.",1
"(I haven’t had to go in and get him for any reason since he started!) On top of all that, I now have a boyfriend who is a real partner in life things. He helps out with childcare when he can, he splits household chores, and we split some bills. I’ve never had this kind of support before and it feels amazing, if not a little strange since it’s a new experience for me. My marriage was certainly not a partnership like this.",0
But it can be done with any white van. Also I’ve seen taxi logos on smaller vehicles work. Just have to be creative and smart and think about what companies start early or work all night. I see posts about trash building up and it becoming hard in a small vehicle. I slept with my girlfriend in a Hyundai Sonata for 9 months.,0
"I remember thinking “What the hell is he doing ?!”. This guy was so tall, so much heavier than me… He grabbed me, was on top of me, told me to “shut my fucking mouth right now”. I tried so hard to move, but I couldn’t… I remember him spitting on his dick, and then he penetrated me, his hand over my mouth. It was so violent, so painful. I can still feel the sweat on his cheek...",1
"Did you guys ever experience similar periods as I did? A friend of mine from work recently ended up going through a similar situation to what I did and is also homeless now, and the way he describes his life right now is very similar to how mine was when it started for me. Unexpectedly fun and fast paced. And he's also noticed the rather curious trend where its a roll of the dice as to whether the person you decide to let know you're homeless will either be really nice about it or a disgustingly hostile. Funny story, I once had a woman cuss me out in the middle of Wal-mart specifically because she decided that me having rather heavily tattooed arms was just awful (my words not hers lol) when I don't have a place to live.",0
"The ""me too"" movement I've found to be extremely inspirational and empowering. I am no longer ashamed of what happened to me, but I still don't feel like I'm healing. I was hoping that these flashbacks and the anxiety, fear and dread would go away over time, but they haven't. How do people cope? What do you read?",1
"I asked him how he's doing to fund this, if there are any bursaries and if so, how much these are, but he never gives a clear answer.   ---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend is unemployed, looking for 'perfect' job until he starts his Medicine degree, unsure how he will fund this degree. I resent him for poor financial judgement and day-time chilling. How to change this?",1
"NEW STUFF: I called the movers last week and told them to refund both the deposit and the money order and gave them until that Monday (7/17) before I filed a criminal complaint. This morning (7/17) I called both the ""billing department"" and my moving manager guy to tell them that the money still hadn't been returned. The billing department hung up on me and Arthur, the moving manager, told me that the billing department had not, in fact, hung up on me. I told him I'd be going to the police.",0
"I'm not the kind of guy who likes to ask for help with things like this, especially when it feels like there are so many people with worse problems, but after three years of trying to save up on a disabled person's income with nothing but failure (as soon as I have a little saved, something else comes up), and at the encouragement of my online acquaintances, I have decided to try setting up a gofundme account in order to get dentures: <url> I feel like I have tried every government assistance program and charity in the US, but as a 35 year old male, there is no help for me. I'm not young enough for assistance, I'm not old enough for assistance, and I am not a female with kids, so there is just no help available. As proof here is the thread I made three years ago. I wasn't asking for anything then, just showing off the teeth I had pulled: <url>",1

"BACKGROUND: paul and i met 1.5 years ago on okcupid and hit it off right away. at the time, we were both in long-term open relationships with other people, so we fell into a pretty quick routine that involved seeing each other once a week for a meal or drinks and sex [the best of his life, allegedly]. About 6 months into it/the December before last, he and his partner of 8 years broke up, which sent him into a bit of a depression/naturally intense period of introspection. Independently/for unrelated reasons, my own longterm relationship also came to an end. Paul and I saw each other less but kept in touch.",0
"I didn’t tell her my feelings, because I value her too much, but do not want to hurt her. I just want to let go of all my feelings, but I can’t. There’s only a few days left at school, after which we might go our different ways. But I have this strange feeling inside, that I do not want to live in any sort of regret, about not telling her how I felt. It’s just really weird.",0
"Was the entire hood in the world trying to off me? What’s going on? Those are the thoughts of my mind every time something like that happens and it wasn’t the first time I’ve heard, “God does everything for a reason.” A while back, when I had a home a man needed a way home with his old man, and asked me to drive the old man’s car because the old guy was too drunk to drive and the young thug didn’t have a license. Of course I said hell yeah, he’s got his pops with him… and I’d miss driving, and good karma.",0
I believe he has real deep seeded mental health issues. I also know he verbally and emotionally abuses his wife.

"I paid off some of my credit card debt a couple days ago, but my company also charged me on their automatic pay system. I barely had enough this paycheck to cover just the single payment; when this extra payment processes it's going to cost me an overdraft fee. I am in no position to let that happen and so I need money to cover for it, as well as cover for my student loan payment which also hasn't processed yet.

"Here's a homebaked metaphor. This is only a reflection of my personal views, and is not designed to reflect anybody else's experience. ----- Just as witches and wizards in the novels avoid mentioning Voldemort's name, those who have experienced a trauma tend to avoid remembering it, thinking about it, speaking about it, anything that triggers the awful feelings and sensations which a traumatic event conditions us to associate with it.

"So a bit of long back story here, I was adopted as a child not a proper legal adoption, there was a residency order for me to live with my aunt and uncle for an underdetermined amount of time, after a year my aunt and uncle split and my uncle kept me (my aunt was the one I was actually related to) social services never really got involved past this point. My uncle/ adoptive father started dating a woman that I would come to know as my mum (I always knew they weren’t biological) They had a very destructive relationship and my adoptive father was incredibly abusive towards her (like attempted stabbing & trying to set her on fire in front of me) he was never abusive towards me in fact he treated me like I was untouchable which fostered resentment between me and my “mum” They eventually spilt when I was 18 (9 years ago) and I’ve not spoken to my dad since,my mum works in a hospital and just informed me that he was admitted to the ward she works on and potentially has lung cancer. My mum is practically gleeful about it being cosmic karma for him being a horrible person but I’m uncomfortable with how happy she is that he’s ill, I’ve not really spoken to her about it because she’s the one that suffered not me so I can’t really tell her how to deal but it just seems a bit much to me to be happy.",1
I even pressed chargers against him. Unfortunately he still found a way through to me by hooking up with girls that I know and having them make sure I knew about it. Nothing has happened since June and I’m about to be moving far away from him. I struggle with what he did to me every day and the flashbacks occur still. I don’t expect this to ever fully go away but I am 18 now and I can say that I survived this.,1

"I hope I can remember that my anxiety was misguided and ultimately wrong. And more than that, I hope that whoever reads this (if anyone does) can remember it too.

I have vivid, detailed dreams about her sexually, and they upset me throughout the day, and I don't know what to think. Any advice?",1
"Hey, I (m, 18) don't know, what I should do, about my brother. Apart from many different things that are bothering me about him this one is at the moment a big problem, because I often have people here at my house: He doesn't clean the bathroom, which means he doesn't flush the toilet, pees on the ground, leaves sometimes condoms laying around etc. He doesn't listen to my parents or me.",0
"But I have something I think is important enough to at least be worth your time. I’m getting the word out about my wife’s surgery fund. She just got the message back today from her workplace denying her disability for her surgery. 😦 Long story short this was devastating for us, we are both pretty frugal people that try to save our money but sadly (at 20 and 19) we haven’t had much time outside of home to amass enough savings. This surgery is a catch 22 however as if she doesn’t get it she will have a 75-80% chance of becoming either wheelchair bound or if she’s luck just unable to ever walk up or down stairs.",1
"It’s like hes expecting my tummy is spilling over my jeans like a muffin(it’s not) I’m still a size small instead of an Xsmall like I used to be when 14 but that’s pretty fucking normal I reckon.its like god help me if I’m a medium right? Today I lashed out at him by saying omg dad it’s cuz I’m wearing these pants today ( the pants which are wide, loos high waisted and make ass look bigger), instead of skinny jeans so I obv gained like 10 pounds or tonnes of kilos or whatever overnight. Later on he said “it’s so easy to make you mad you shouldn’t react that way just cus you don’t think you’re fat”  this made me think that he is doing this to get a rise out of me which isn’t cool for 55 yo dad or you know an adult. Or another reason is probably cuz he is getting older and living a sedentary lifestyle, it’s the holiday season and he put on weight he’s not doing anything about it and he’s taking it out on me, he’s a bit chubby but not like overly flabby it’s just most shirts don’t fit anymore. Anyway this part isn’t relevant to my relationship but I’d like to share anyway.",0

"Once I committed mentally to therapy and knew I could pay for it, and that if me and the therapist didn't click that I would keep trying until someone did, the anxiety just got better, in the weeks leading up to therapy.

"Hey all. Friday i had a woodworking competition and everything went really good at first but then it just got worse and worse and my ptsd started to kick in. I felt really aggressive and angry and sad all at once. My friends saw that there was something going on and asked what was going on but at that moment everything that gets told is getting picked up as bad in my head so it only made me angry'r.

"I was going through a hard time after our breakup (started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist). In the span of the 2.5 years since our breakup I have had other boyfriends and hookups. Some of my hookups happened to be some of his old friends, the most recent happening 11 months ago. I never talked to these guys leading up to the hook ups or since, it was purely just spur of the moment drunk sex. Recently me and my ex have reconnected after 2.5 years of no contact.",0

"Back ground, me and my girl have been homeless independently for about a year and we've been together for six months now. We lived in Olympia Washington for a while and where trying to make it and eventually move out of the toxic town. I received about 3.5k$ worth of back pay EFC payments the state owed me and shortly after my girl's grandmother died and she wanted to make it to the funeral so we decided to make a road trip of it, get jobs in florida and be set. We figured the lower cost of living would offset the vastly lower minimum wage and we'd be fine. We both got jobs at her old workplace (Wendy's, never go to the Lakeland Highlands Wendy's so many healthcode violations btw) and worked for two months and got fired for bs reasons (I got trained wrong and wasn't told about 60% of my responsibilities by a guy who was on his phone 75% of the time and quit a week later, she overslept and no call no showed one day and got immediately taken off the schedule)",1

But this incident has been troubling me for a couple of days now. I guess I am just sick and tired of my trauma interfering with my relationships. I feel bad for my boyfriend- he shouldn't have to put up with this stuff. I know he loves me and he is terribly worried. But I also feel bad for me.,1
"I'll call him out on his behavior or try to stand up for myself, and then he'll either get mad and give me the silent treatment and not apologize, or he'll tell me I'm lying and that he didn't do or say something. Even though I know he did. He criticizes my parenting and tells me I'm lazy since I'm a SAHM (even though I do all the cleaning, cooking, taking care of our toddler, taking care of our pets and anything else around the house with little help from him because he feels entitled to not do anything since he works and I don't). To top it all off, he doesn't think he has a drinking problem... yet always drinks at least 3 beers or more every night. He also slapped my son and left a mark on his face while we were camping (I didn't see him do it because I went to go pee but saw it and asked about it when I got back).",1
"But she says she can't stand hearing it because she's got enough on her plate as she actually suffers with depression herself.

"I can recall one situation where I was accused of taking her credit card (I was 6 years old and before we had computers), the one she left in store, so decided to ransack my bedroom, destroying most of the gifts I got the Christmas. This resulted in being given a crumpled, unapologetic five-pound note. No sorry, nothing said, just the silence and dark stair. From a young age I was subjected to social seclusion, I was not allowed to hang out with any of the local kids in my town. Apparently, they were all ‘bad’ children and believed I would be influenced by them resulting in becoming, well I am not to sure what she expected.",1

That was a strong indicator to leave her the fuck alone.",0
"I'm new to Reddit and have only really discussed my issues with trauma and PTSD with my partner and therapist, and I am struggling with the random dissociative cycles of derealization and depersonalization. And I'm so tired of it. I've been in therapy for half of my life. I write and also listen to music to help when I'm having issues, but it never feels like enough.

My mind started to wander off to things other than my struggle for air, and one thought stuck with me ""the sun is really bright and warm on my face.""

"Now he is enraged because I said months ago that maybe internet access was not a bad idea, that there was some stuff there that may connect him more to others. He had been asking for months how to access the internet for free, and I just did not know what to say, he mentioned it so much, besides he would have to get internet access from a company if he wanted to use the internet reliably.

"Its hard knowing that everyone around you doesn't have these issues, It's hard that it takes an extreme amount of work just to make a normal day in life go by smoothly(which it almost never does) At first I felt like I had a grasps on this whole PTSD thing because it made sense when I first got diagnosed but the longer it's been the harder this is to deal with. Do you know what it's like to constantly feel uncomfortable in your own skin but you can never turn it off? this is the answer I give when people ask me what's wrong, because there's always more than one thing going on at the same time.

"I don't use accommodations at school, so being able to finally hit that goal feels amazing, it feels as if a part of me is finally back, and that all my hard work, sweat, tears, and angry words are getting me somewhere. Two years isn't much, and I know many of you struggle even more than I do, but if you take nothing else from this remember this: You've already made it through the hardest day of your life, you're sitting there reading this having lived past that day, and that's no small feat. In some ways you may feel weaker now, but considering that you've lived through your darkest day already, are you sure you're not just stronger in an unfamiliar way?

"My Social Security disability case is still winding its way through the labyrinth of that particular bureaucracy, but there'd be no need to worry about me cutting into your food, as I do receive SNAP. I *could* get a small storage unit for my belongings while I ""hold out"" around these people, though that'd be less than ideal (and dangerous)... and paying for the unit would cut into the funds I'd need to cover fuel and such getting out and going up North. Hence why I'm trying posting here. I suppose it's also worth mentioning that my friend's car is on the smaller side, which might make a tight squeeze, so if anyone has a larger vehicle, and is able and willing to move me and my stuff from Fort Worth to Fort Wayne, that'd be cool.

An hour had passed of us at the event and we were scheduled to go on the boat ride in about 15 minutes. However, since that hour had passed, her boyfriend refused to stay any longer and made both of them go home, even though she really wanted to go on the boat. These are some of the bigger events that have pissed me off; however, they have the same fight everyday regarding their differing values, and her wanting to do things/live her life and him refusing to make any sort of sacrifice or compromise to do that with her, resulting in her just settling to the situation.

I trust and maintain that the benefits of proper use, together with conversational therapy, is very efficient for many people, and I hope this has been said on this sub.

Buttt every once in a while (A handful of times a year, tops) something will realllly set me over the edge, and send me into an intense anxiety spiral where I compulsively ask 5 or so different friends for advice on what to do, post a lot of threads online about what I should do, and ruminate on the topic for days or weeks. Sometimes I'll have chats in messenger about whatever it is that will draw out over an entire 3-4 hour period.",0
I thought I did well but I was severely depressed. That weekend was my birthday weekend and he made it miserable. He said I was a brat to ever think that it was a special day. I received the silent treatment from him and him being drunk and telling me that i'm worthless and don't do anything for him. I didn't even get a gift or affection.,1
"So I got freaked out and cancelled again. Now I’m worried they’ll find out about it later and send me to collections to damage my credit and ruin my life without me ever knowing. I hope this sounds crazy to everyone else as well because it’s eating me alive. Nothing helps at this point, not even medication. Why do I always do this?",1
"And I can't accept it anymore. I can't allow it anymore. It's time to come clean about the pain it causes me to have this sorry excuse of a man be so close to someone that is forever connected to me. Any suggestions, personal experiences, or strategies you used to help relieve the anxiety that is experienced before and during would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you for taking some time to help.",1
"We met about 2.5 years ago, both somewhat fresh off our respective divorces. I felt we had a real connection, we fell for each other hard, dated (eventually lived together) for a little less than a year before she got pregnant. We were both really happy as we had both talked about wanting children - at the time we got pregnant we were ""not NOT trying,"" we had definitely had many conversations and were both on board and happy to have a child together. We felt we had met our true love in each other. Things have been rough since the birth of our son.",1
"I don't know. I keep overthinking everything and I am worrying about what it would be like to be with him for an extended amount of time. What if it is horrible and we end up hating each other? I fear that I cannot deliver what he wants and deserves emotionally and sexually, and those fears stunt my ability to love him freely. I am wary of the fact I have no control over the outcome of that.",1
"Hold on, this is going to be a long one folks. I met Alex at work about a year ago. We collaborated on few projects being in similar roles but never worked directly on the same team. When I first met him, I wasn't romantically interested in him. I was in a relationship and I knew the age difference and it was just not something that would be on my radar.",0
"One thing I'm thankful for in this mess of my life is my friend that has listened to me, held me through my panic attacks and talked me down from ledges. He's still there for me even though he's seen me at some pretty dark places. Ok, rant/vent over. Thank you for being here. Thank you for listening.",0
"I only get it when I have a flashback or strong reaction to a trigger. I notice it sticks around even when I feel emotionally calm and can stick around for a long time after the trigger, like days or weeks. It’s a new symptom I think. Also been having lots of nightmares again recently. Not sure what to do as I’m not currently in therapy, but I am waiting to be seen at a mental health clinic.",1
"But in that moment neither my words nor my body made a difference...he did what he wanted.... I wanted to push him, kick him, shout...but...i couldnt move. There were times he didn't listen to me but I never thought it would lead to him forcing himself onto me. I didn't trust I'd know how he'd react if I did or said anything...He wasn't the gentle and respectful person I thought he was. I left after the shower but when I got home, I broke down.",1
But I could feel construction workers staring at me. I know I might be paranoid but I don’t want to take chances anymore I’m scared. I already paid for a year at the gym (about 6 months ago.) Do you think I should talk to someone about getting at least a partial refund for the 6 months? I don’t want to bring my situation up to them and have them say sorry but not our problem.,1
"Since this happened during a pivotal time in his developing sexuality, his body reacted despite his revulsion. He has been prescribed a myriad of medications to try and combat the dreams but not much has helped. It will work for a week to a few weeks, but the dreams manifest no matter what. He had been seeing a cognitive therapist, but she was not helping much. I personally believe that he needs someone who can get a bit deeper and work on the root of the problems and that the dreams are his subconscious’ way of screaming for help.",0
"I had been searching for a new place to live since the start of that 6 month notice but I was not capable of finding anywhere to go mainly due to not being able to afford any additional expenses nor was there any source for me to receive the money I required, and since then I have been living outside for the past 5 weeks. During my stay outdoors, I currently work and maintain 3 jobs; one that pays me officially and 'on the books', while the other two serve as jobs that pay me on the side and 'off the books'. This isn't an easy affair either as they all require me to travel to different locations around the area by walking or use of public transportation, which is one of the expenses I am forced to cover on my own and my lack of sleep does not help matters regarding my performance as these jobs. Currently, and for the past 5 weeks, I've been staying at the beach nearby my old home as this is the only area where I am not told to leave by any authority figures, such as on-site workers and police patrolling the area, and also the only area I felt remotely safe at. Recently the weather has gotten pretty bad and this place is no longer the safe haven it once was for me.",1
"I am the person you go to to get stuff done, or if you want the right advice. I run marathons, kill it at the gym, learn languages and study for degrees in my spare time. My finances are in scrupulous shape. I am a top quartile parent and spouse. I'm comfortable (or at least not visibly uncomfortable) in any company.",0
"But one night, I somehow picked up on a pattern or loop in the cricket sounds, and I haven't been able to listen to it since. My brother had the same model in the room next to mine, and I ended up getting him a new one for his birthday because even puddles through the wall, every single loop felt like an ice pick to my forehead. It's like my brain knows what sound is coming and the auditory auto-correct is mentally painful and dread inducing. Any advice/suggestions would be helpful-- can't seem to get the right combination of experiences/symptoms from misophonia, sensory processing, etc. Thanks!",1
"Then i start getting jaw aches and collarbone pain or back pain and I have been to A+E several times and every time I am healthy bar one time i had a chest wall muscle inflammation. Then of course these pains panic me and the cycle goes on for hours. I just want to know why this happens and if I can help it but doctors dont listen to me just say ""well we can up your doseage or put you back on those pills that knocked you out but ruined your functioning life"" Does anyone else get similar things? And how do you deal with doctors that just dont care.",0
"I take solo back packing trips and my friends really see me as someone fearless and free-spirited. It makes opening up about my mental health issues kinda difficult because they can't ""see"" me acting this way. I have a lot of anxiety and depression issues around my romantic relationships. I also have depersonalization issues, and want to be alone more often then not. I think the fact that I can be so outgoing and positive most of the time, my friends don't realize that I struggle quite a bit some days.",1
"Also deflects my attempts at flirting. How do I communicate with him the way I want him to romance me if it's against his nature? Is it even possible? Should I just try to change myself? It's been five years and I'm still having this problem, what do I do?",0
"This made me feel somewhat uncomfortable, but I laughed it off and tried to go along with it, and trust him and take it as an innocent compliment. He asked if I wanted to smoke some weed with him, and I knew already from past experience that I tend to have very bad reactions to it. He told me that if I freak out then he wouldn’t let anything bad happen to me. I was having a pretty good day, so I smoked some weed with him. It was actually okay being high.",0
"I've suffered from a mild anxiety disorder w/ depression (diagnosed) for about 4 years, all while I've been with my (now) DH. DH is logical/rational to a fault, and while generally supportive, cannot understand how I feel and act when depressed, or suffering from particularly bad anxiety. No matter how I try to explain to him, tell him that I literally cannot help it or just magically lift myself out of it, he insists that I'm being ""dramatic"". It makes me feel all the more vulnerable, and all the more difficult to speak for myself. What advise/experience do you have for helping someone understand who has never experienced depression and/or anxiety that the disorder is ""real"" and not in active control of the victim?",1
Any tips for making more friends? Tl;dr: I've had very few friends throughout my life. Recently I've tried reaching out to a lot of people but almost all of them will decline my offer to hang out at some point. I guess maybe this has to do with how I am socially awkward in the past but I've also been told that I am trying too hard. Any tips for making more friends?,1
"So I met this girl last year, in November. Although we only dated officially for around a month, the feelings became very intense. Around the week before Christmas, she confessed she had been cheating on me with someone. At the time she was very distant towards me, and of course the cheating explained that. She and I met up last week to talk, I thought I would get closure but all I felt afterwards was a deep sense of regret.",1
"At the very least, I need help keeping the RV running so that I can get food at least, keep going to the doctor to see if I can get well enough to work again. And if i end up filing for bankruptcy and lose my home (as might happen in the next month or two, to be honest), I'll need it to sleep in. So if anyone to help out even a little bit with this $575, I could really use it. Thank you! Update:",0
"It does not help that my mom leans on me and only me emotionally, when it comes to my father who I don't have a relationship with and all their financial issues etc...I am dealing with a lot personally, and then on the outside there family stuff on top of me too, and I feel trapped honestly. I went to see a counselor in college and he thought if I got more of a routine going I would be fine, he also was extremely judgemental and scolded me for not coming into college regularly, he didn't believe me things I told him, so I left. I did go to a counselor about 12 times after the abusive relationship ended, I still felt vulnerable and scared leaving it that place and told her I don't feel ready to stop this. She said there was nothing more she could do. Now I am at the point where I feel like there is nothing nobody can do for me, I feel emotionally trapped and I don't know what to do, or where to go anymore.",1
"I am not even sure what to say. My girlfriend was really, really mad. Not at my family, they're just basing this off what they hear, but at my sister. And honestly, I am really mad too. What the fuck could she be saying about me?",1
"Typing is keeping me from facing my terror. The nightmares have mostly subsided, but without my wife keeping the ghost away, I'm scared the dreams will come back. I keep recalling the most vivid one of them, it replays itself over and over in my head. I've seen many therapists over the years, and sadly none of them have any understanding of what I'm going through, or how to treat it. Their answer is drug me up until I'm numbed to the point where I no longer feel human.",1
"I was told by a friend of mine that if you ship something straight to the airport, and just have the receiver pick it up, you would be saving an enormous amount of $$ as opposed to sending it directly to the recipient. Does this hold any truth, anyone know? If you've got any ideas like the one I've posted I would be more then thrilled to hear about it! P.S. The items vary in size, so if you know about a method that if best suited for, lets say items under 5 pounds, I would still love to hear about it!",0
"I started a new job last Tuesday, and I have had some pretty severe anxiety most days, especially my first day. (As probably to be expected) This is my second job, and unlike my first one I have ZERO customer interaction so my social anxiety hasn't been nearly as bad as it was with my previous job. Now tomorrow morning I start my second week, and I was feeling fine all day today, but it's time to sleep and I can't even lay down without freaking out. I'd hate to call in sick after only one week but I don't know if I can make it like this. I'm freaking out and it's stopping me from getting any sleep.",1
I just wanted to say thank you to everyone that posts on here. I just found this subreddit yesterday and reading all of your guys' posts have made me feel so much less alone. Knowing that other people understand what I'm going through for some reason has helped me tremendously. Particularly a post that someone made about feeling like their trauma isnt real and like convincing yourself that it didnt happen. I have felt like I'm crazy for years because I was in such deep denial about what happened to me.,0
"And I woke up. It took 3 nurses and some sort of shot to calm me down when I woke up and I had to lay there limp for an hour in the recovery room by myself. They then put me in the maternity ward, sharing a room with a mother who just had her baby. The second surgery was a few days later because the surgery was incomplete. I found out when the part of the baby came out and I slipped on it in the bathroom, my husband found me in a pool of blood crying on the ground.",1
Then I started to notice how much of a temper he has. The first few weeks he was good at hiding it but it started coming out. He was full of compliments for me but they were pretty generic and he took me on a bunch of dates. The last few days I was kind of avoiding him and he kind of tried getting controlling. Yesterday I was going to spend Christmas eve with him and his family and I tried bringing up some major concerns about the way things were going and he flipped out and started screaming and throwing shit.,1
"I noticed that towards the end of my stay at the school he had grown protective, maybe flirty. We were constantly talking, he would pull me out of classes ,I hardly attended, to talk. He would cut someone's counseling session short to see me sooner. If any other authority figure tried to talk to me he was quickly my shadow. He had set me up with several services to do with therapy (I had already seen a lot but he made room for more.)",0
"The last Sticky thread before this one: <url> There is all kinds of things that friends or therapists say which has helped us, what helps for one person doesn't help for another, but I think it may be helpful if people share what has helped them here. It doesn't have to specifically be related to abuse, it can be advice that helps you in general. I guess what helps me is to remember that any one person can only do their best under the circumstances, not more.",0
"This is all relevant because I'm slowly realizing that **keeping my relationship from my mother isn't sustainable**. I'm not a good liar. Eventually, the truth has to come out, because I cannot live like this. Problem-- my mother would HATE my boyfriend. Being a narcisist, she can't stand when I give anyone more attention or devotion than her.",1
"We will get through this and I am determined, even it means going to a shelter, to get affordable housing, so i never end up in this situation again! Ive been financially abused in small ways for almost a year, paying more than my share, while he saved. Being forced into buying a computer we couldnt afford then had it thrown at me every fight due to credit card he continuously used (kept under 1k) I also was forced to be precise on where i put things especially when cleaning as to not disrupt him. He hid snacks and 420 from me when I did most of the purchasing.",1
"She has had wounds on her face once, one doctor saw them, wrote them down, and offered to call the police. They replied that she'd have to come there by herself and sue her husband. Which of course did not happen. Turns out I get really numb as the only way to not get dragged into this emotional swamp, but is a hell for its own. Hating every single contact here.",1
In the last year I have developed some health problems. I started having seizures and because of them I had to miss work. Because of that I got fired. I was doing okay still while looking for another job by donating plasma. But my car got repossessed a few days ago and I haven’t been able to get there to donate.,1
"I know this is kind of all over the place, but i want to ask: should I have broken up with her before? am I a bad person for sticking around? how can i find peace and happiness?

My mil is capable of all of that, but she has a harder time. We have a history with my SIL.",0
"- Constantly forgets where she put her cell phone (even though she keeps it in the same designated spot) - She was the money-person in my family.

"I've been trying to remain hopeful that these symptoms won't really start improving until 6-8 weeks like the first time I took it to relieve depression. It doesn't help that after looking up SSRI withdrawal online, I've read reinstating might not work the longer I'm off it and it's recommended to take a very low dose in order to alleviate symptoms. This is leaving me worried since I've stopped for a month and took a higher dosage than I last left off. It doesn't say what happens if I happen to take a high dosage, so I'm worried I'm making things worse by continuing with this high dosage and I have no idea what to do right now. I feel very messed up and I'm scared these withdrawal symptoms will never go away or may become permanent.",1
"I currently have nowhere to live. My ""friends"" have made excuses as to why they cant help me out. This sucks. It's times like this where the world seems like an incredibly dark place and the best way to escape the pain is to leave it. IDK.",1
"But I still froze and cried through the entire thing. Some of the sensations brouvht me to memories of old sensations, andI felt really vulnerable, trapped, and ashamed, and I haven't been able to shake it off all day. Part of it is that we have company staying in our home; so I don't feel like I have the space to care for myself, and it just further perpetuates the shame feeling. In fact, I felt too ashamed to go home right after, and drove around for an hour and a half before I felt like I at least i wouldn't have to explain myself to my boyfriend's family. Additionally, because it's my boyfriend's family, my boyfriend has been unavailable to me all day.",1
"I'd never heard this idea until recently, and I'm starting to see it cropping up more, always in opposition to any kind of support (or even empathy) for the homeless - any attempt to help the homeless is pointless because 'most' homeless people want to be homeless; therefore housing programs/assistance, mental health & substance abuse support are wasted because the homeless are too lazy to get themselves out of homelessness and 'enjoy' their condition, because they don't have to work, because they don't have to pay bills, because they don't have responsibilities, because they're lazy etc. I strenuously disagree with this, and I feel like it's an attempt to move the goalposts; there's a growing awareness that homeless people may not necessarily be homeless because they got themselves into that position and they 'deserve' it, but because of substance abuse issues and mental health problems, coupled with a breakdown in social network. But that's a lie, or 'lefty propaganda', for some people; they want to believe, despite whatever legitimate reasons some homeless may have for not being in shelters, say, that it's a *moral failing* \- going full circle, they don't deserve help because their homelessness is a consequence of decisions they made. Thoughts?",0
I screamed and my mum helped me until I passed out. I went to the doctor the next day and they referred me on to get a diagnosis for PTSD as well. I get flashies about once every couple of months now and it gets more and more terrifying each time. About a year and a half before GCSE's (finals for you Americans) my anxiety started to show. I would be super stressed about every little test in school and had a baseline amount of stress building up as I got closer to my exam dates.,1
"And it may be a bit out of context, but I do have to thank my 4 best men for being here with me all the way, I couldn’t do this without them. Finally, we are here at the present day. It’s been 2 years since we broke up. My ex still hates me with a burning passion, but I have learned to ignore it and have mostly moved on from the experience. I don’t hold any sort of animosity towards her, but I have had the tendency to start to drift off and start pitying myself and reflecting out loud a bit too much when in conversation with my dear friend.",0

"I started talking to a girl, 'J', on Tinder about a month ago. She's funny, attractive and quick-witted, however she was apprehensive to meet up for a drink to get to know each other in person straight away. We are both from the same town (we matched over Christmas) however she lives an hour and a half away in a much larger city. She first claimed that she could not afford to travel to see me even when she was back in my town (she also refused to let me pay for anything involving her, including travel to her city to meet her), however said last week that she did not want to meet me until she knew that I was genuine about her, and wanted to talk on the phone every evening for a week. If I did this, then she would meet me on the day afterwards.",0
"It is not like her - even when she was that age - to succumb to pressure like that. I'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when I think that way but, again, knowing my wife how I know her - as someone that's not afraid to call BS- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no. I just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions. I can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""This is BS, I'm out"" afterwards. But that she stuck around and let it happen multiple times just seems odd to me.",1

As time goes by I’ll get furniture a little at a time and slowly make the place more cozy and more my own. I can’t believe it’s finally over.",0

I can't even talk about the day she left me because it was so traumatic. I can't even admit it to myself. It was awful beyond words and I can't tell anyone.

Breathing and mindfulness have been very helpful, a little bit of acceptance and making sure my blood sugar doesn't drop. It hasn't been easy but I'm almost at the finish line. Then I can go home and sleep!",0
"I was raised by a narcissistic grandmother and emotionally unavailable mother. In fact, when I was born, she tried to take it upon herself to take full custody away from my mother because apparently my mom was 'unfit' to be a mother. She never did because she found out that my biological father might have had to be involved. My grandma kept me away from my father my entire life, he barely knows I exist, I've never spoken directly with him, in fact, his identity was hidden from me for 22 years, up until last May. My grandmother was very emotionally abusive towards me as a child.",0
"My therapist asks me point blank what I want to talk about, so I talk about the things that were bothering me in the last two weeks. I asked him for suggestions or tips regarding the trich, he did not really give me any advice and instead read off a document to me for an hour and just printed it off at the end of the apt and gave it to me anyways. And yes the information is beneficial, but I can find all the same stuff on this sub's side bar. I'm slowly becoming more and more frustrated. I want to be open for help, I mean this was a huge step for me to even schedule an appointment much less continue going for a month or so.",0
"I never searched for a man to make me happy or be my knight in shining armour, but he found me anyway. And yes he did rescue me…mostly because I let him. And in case you ask yes I am happy – in life, in love and within myself. Maybe I was a victim once, but I’m not a victim anymore. I chose freedom and safety, and I hope any woman reading this is brave enough to find those things too <3",0
"I do have intense anxiety to the point it affects my daily life and prevents me from performing the smallest tasks such as making a phone call to get an appointment. However, I do not know if my anxiety is a result from what had happened to me as a child or me experiencing unpleasant experiences in highschool. I just know that my rape makes my anxiety worse sometimes. I do get triggered by anything that reminds me of unpleasant memories of my rape. The only time I break down is when I am severely distressed or my feelings are so bottled up that a trigger would set me off crying.",1

"I specifically told my father NOT to lose my money gambling. I'm not that depressed since I sort of expected this to happen, but I am still severely disappointed. I am literally continuing to lose respect for my own father. Of course, it isn't so much the money, but rather that he would do this to me when I told him not to. I fear that if this continues, my father will continue to waste away his own life as well as damage mine.",1
"He finally lets me inside and we begin to talk (he's drunk as always, our schedules differ by a couple of hours so whenever I would get home at 6 he was always drunk). He is sat up against my counter calling me names and I smack his chest. Worst mistake of my life. I never should have hit him. And I fully believe that what you dish out is what you get.",0
"I know I am still young and there is so much more coming in life but sometimes, I just feel this is not where I want to be and I sometimes get sad that I am not doing the things I want to be doing. I really want to travel and it really is hard to find people to go with. I would love to go solo but I am sometimes fearful of asking my parents because I don't want them to convince me otherwise/tell me no. I have this huge wanderlust and I want to see the world and constantly learn. I did apply to a grad program with many global opportunities to fulfill the dream of mine and I am excited as well.",0
"I broke up with my bf of 2.5 yrs on Sunday after suspecting he was the reason why I had fallen into depression for the past year or so. I became more irritable, rude, negative and angry... which was not like my usual positive, polite, and bubbly self. He was often very negative, had anger issues/tantrums, impatient, interrupted me a lot, would ditch me for cocaine, didn't know how to drink alcohol (often consumes until he pukes), was a hypochondriac, always broke (yet had money for weed/shatter or sports betting or junk food or alcohol...), but at the same time did not look after his own health unless I pushed him to... just a lot of care-taking and issues. He has depression and anxiety as well. One of the things that really killed me inside about him was his last girlfriend who had died in a car crash about 1 year before he met me.",1
"But I noticed recently, that my sleeping problems might have a reason. I first thought it‘s just something physical, the lack of iron in my blood or something.. never thought it would be something this deep.

"Fun fact: <name> helped me out a bit a few years ago through Twitter. You can check his tweets with/about me around July/Aug of 2014. (I deleted my Twitter account since, but just signed up again.) <name> paid for a month of weekly, remote sessions with a popular, West Coast therapist. That brilliant therapist is the only one I've ever clicked with, before or since.",0
"I was nice, and it got me no where, so I was rude, it got worse. I compliment my mom and my sister as much as I can, I tell my sister I’m proud of her, I tell both of them I love them, I take care of my mom the best I can, but I’m still their verbal punching bag. Every day I tell my mom that I love her, that she looks pretty, etc etc, but it ends up in her replying with “you’re gonna fail this year you know that right? You need to do your school work”. My sister called me naive and immature for not making fun of people’s interests and looks.",1
"We had an argument, then he started trying to break my phone by bending it. I intervened and begged him not to and he stopped short of breaking it. I was a domestic violence victim before in a previous relationship and I buried those memories, but this incident made me remember some of those memories and I feel traumatized and scared to be experiencing the same things again. I feel scared and I don't know if this would escalate into something worse. We don't have kids, and we've been married for a couple months.",1
"Even as I’m cooking, he’s still screaming in my face, telling me that I’m done at my job and I need to quit now. I yell back, something about him not having a job and he grips me up from behind with an arm around my throat, and I grab the knife I was using to cut chicken and tell him to get off of me. He lets go, and we scream a bit more. I made a smart remark, and he jabbed me in my face. It busted the inside of my lip and I was bleeding.",1

"Sorry in advance, just need to get shit off my chest.. This has been a spectacularly shitty year to be homeless, trying to recover from health issues that have me terrified (and cut off from health insurance), facing criminal tresspass charges that turned out to be false, but took 8 months to prove my innocence, dealing with incompetent social services that JUST DON'T GIVE A SHIT, to finally getting into what I thought would be a place safe against the weather, but turned out to be basically living in a refrigerator, and now I'm back on the streets with moldy fucking gear and all options here exhausted. I'm fucking sick, in pain, and nowhere to sleep but in a doorway in a town that hates (and I really mean hates) the homeless, and  all I can think of to do is hang on til I can GTFO, without getting the shit beat out of me. Anyway, thanks for listening, and for what it's worth, please everyone have a safe holiday.",1
"All of my money goes to rent, utilities, and credit cards, and delivery food a few times a month when I'm too beat to cook. My boyfriend was nearly broke as me, and was leaning on my credit and foodstamps from time to time, leaving me in significant debt. We are breaking up after five years, because my pelvic organs are collapsing downwards, making for painful sex. He hung in there for three years of sexlessness, so I can't fault him.... but he's leaving in the next few months as soon as he gets the money to move out. I've got to figure my shit out.",1
I'm in college now and got high last night and felt pretty sad. I'm a wreck. I thought I've overcome this all but I'm just feeling alone again. After trauma i started isolating myself and attaching to creative work to get a sense of worth. I declined socially by a lot and can't feel connected to anyone past a surface level.,1
"I stopped, looked down, looked at her. I took her hand, took a step onto the other side, into the other city. I turned to face her and took her other hand. I looked into her deep eyes and said, “This is the first city we’ve traveled to together, may we travel to many more”. I pulled her over the city line and kissed her.",0
" After doing this twice, she sent me a message on Instagram about a month ago saying ""how dare I check out of her life and pretend to still care about her or her family"" and that she ""didn't think things would turn out THIS badly"" for the two of us in terms of ""remaining friends."" We had tried being ""just friends"" several times, but we pushed that barrier several times. We even mutually discussed it. I thought this was something we both wanted, but perhaps I was wrong? Her husband is in a line of work in which he interfaces with large groups of people.",0
"Hello everyone. I am wondering what experiences people have with using Mirtazapine as their main antidepressant for depressive and anxious symptoms (low energy, heavy feeling, irritability, concentration problems, insomnia, inability to complete mundane everyday tasks, social anxiety, fear of embarrassment, worry or overthinking about socialization, etc)? I am in therapy using a mixed method approach so suggestions of therapy aren't relevant. I have just begun proper psychotherapy, and I am looking for something to help me when dealing with reality outside the therapist office. My depression/anxiety has been building over the past 3 months after a long remission period and due to current circumstances has nearly swung full steam over my everyday life.",1
"Two years ago we moved to a different city for his work. He earns a lot more than me and his job offers a lot more career progression, so I wanted to support him. I’ve always thought we were a good team, there have been times where he’s struggled financially and I’ve helped him out no question. We talked about the extra money he’d be able to save by walking to work (2 mins away,) and it seemed as though we were on the same page for what we wanted in the future; buy our own place, a car and start a family. So I thought all was on the right track.",0
"Things my boyfriend does make me feel bad sometimes (for no reason actually), like when he doesn´t text me back for a few hours ( because he´s really busy with work but he texts me back whenever he can, I know it ) and I start having weird thoughts, like ""Is he already tired or bored of me? Is this just another guy who made me fall in love with him and think that he loves me and cares about me, and he actually doesn´t give a damn about me?"" I don´t want to have these thoughts, so I try to stop myself from thinking about that all, but sometimes I just can´t stop and I feel too bad ( for no real reason actually because I honestly feel like he loves me a lot. ). I feel like a bad anxiety attack is coming, and I can´t stop it.",1
"Hey guys, circumstances in my life has brought me to being homeless starting tomorrow. I live in Central Florida and the reason why I come to this position is due to my car breaking down, not being able to make it to work since its a 35 mile commute, and now that I can't pay rent, I have to leave the room I'm renting. Lately though Ive been thinking a lot of leaving to New York. I'll be homeless there, yes, but at least I'll be able to get around with 24/7 transportation. My question is: Is this a good idea?",0
"The thought of leaving my folks behind would definitely not be good for me mentally. I've thought about basically living out of my car, gym memberships to shower daily and laundromats to wash my clothes. Perhaps put all my stuff in storage and just keep working and save some money up. I live on long Island btw. Rent isn't cheap.",1
"If it helps, I just started taking a new birth control that’s a bit stronger than what I was on before, so I’m relatively sure that’s why I feel bad RIGHT NOW. But it’s still bad enough that I can’t do much for myself, and I just don’t understand why they can’t believe that. I think they must see me as a burden or something because it seems like they don’t think I’m worth helping if my problem stems from anxiety rather than a different(“real”) illness. and they’ve decided they are the judges of that, not me or my doctors. I just don’t know what to do.",1
"I also have pretty bad dissociative episodes which I've had since I was about 5. Anyway, a month ago I was prescribed prazocin to take before bed and I'm just on 1mg since I just started it. I'm wondering if anyone has had success with this med? Because I've gotten to a point in my life where I'm so run down that I just can't anymore. I don't know if I should even bother going up in dose or if it's just another waste of energy",1
"I am starting a full time job over the summer and will be financially set starting in June. May is going to be very hard for me. My rent is 785, I have other bills as well as purchasing groceries. I can pay rent but will be without any money for 2 weeks after that I will be unable to buy food or pay my electric bill. If anyone could help I would be eternally grateful...i feel so bad asking for anything but I just don't know what to do....",1
"The messages are essentially the guy being flirtatious and asking her to come over to his place. My gf’s responses are not flirtatious but definitely welcoming. She responded to his offer by saying “how about we meet halfway and grab some lunch together some time”. She never told me that she was even still in contact with this guy. And their relationship was explicitly sexual, not friendly.",1
"Telling me I wasn't pretty enough, my boobs weren't large enough, I wasn't thin enough, I wasn't a good girlfriend to him, I wasn't making him happy. He told me he didn't feel loved unless I was having sex with him, and only then did he feel happy. He would threaten constantly to leave, and oftentimes did as a power grab when I got ""out of hand"", and then would make me beg for him back. I felt so unsure of myself. I wasn't enough, and that's why he was leaving.",1
"I am also not sure if I should press charges on my mother for stealing my identity, or even bother looking into the student loan fraud. Student loan fraud is incredibly difficult to prove, and reporting identity theft would be a lengthy process. The debt is paid and I almost feel like just running away and forgetting about it. I am 26 and truly terrified because, though I have been on my own before, I have never been completely alone or financially independent. I am shocked and horrified by everything that has happened to me in the last year.",1
"Ok here we go.... My original trauma was being molested by my grandfather starting around 7-8 (my best guess, only have a few memories, could’ve been earlier). I have very few memories of this, although I have gotten some back recently. I don’t know how long it continues for but he died when I was 10/12 or so Around this time I was also severely bullied in school, my cousin being the ring leader.",1
"Hi, I was recently put on Prozac (10mg to start) for anxiety after a really bad panic attack. I am nervous but also hopeful that this will help me. For the first week I cried at least once a day and usually there was no reason, my anxiety is also heightened but I knew these symptoms would occur so I've been dealing with it fine. But for the past like day and a half I feel like my joints are kind of feeling weird. I wouldn't say it's painful just different.",0
"I tell her this, which falls on deaf ears. Next day, we go to work things out. And I freak out when staff at the library call cops over us ""being loud"", I freak out over some very minor warrants. Which leads to her disappearing untill today when we have a meeting with a councilor. While waiting & the drop in center for the shower she assaults me & I block her blows.",1
"He refused to look me in the face and acknowledge what he had done. Several days later, his sister calls me, feigning friendship, asking if I would like to get the cat I had been forced to adopt while living there. When I got home, a multiple hour drive each way, I noticed the cat behaving strangely. This cat was at this point, less than a year after my leaving, almost entirely feral, and infested with a ridiculous number of fleas. I posted on a local forum for my town about ways to help repair this cat’s now-aggressive nature.",0
"But I’m pissed, I waited to long for this like I honestly could have killed myself before they got back to me. I know there’s a lot of people in the system and their funding is low, but this is bullshit! The government doesn’t give a shit about mentally ill people. If they did then there honestly would be way less crime rates and suicide rate because people would be getting the help that they need instead of waiting for some bad shit to happen before they get help. The urgency is just NOT there at all.",1
"John often withholds her very necessary prescription drugs to get his way, which is super messed up. Recently she had a small financial windfall and he became super nice and after they spent it all he reverted. He's extremely manipulative and abusive. She's shown us pictures of bruises. The plan right now is that she'll get her prescription sent to somewhere near us, then while John is at work, she leaves with her service dog, meets us in our car and we take her to our house a few hours away.",0
"Back in November of 2015, my Junior year of college, I was a hermit socially but had many great and supportive friends (funnily enough were 90% women). However, I was lonely as hell, had never dated, and it was driving me mad and depressing me. I didn't let it show though, except to one or two friends who knew me very well. In the month of november I started hanging out with an organic chemistry study group. Two particular women were part of this group.",0
"Anyway. I quit my antidepressants several months ago because I am in a good place now, and I can survive without them. I just find that thoughts like this are still very present, and can be very difficult to deal with. I never do apologize on Facebook. TLDR: I want to apologize on facebook  for not being normal and being awkward AF.",0
"I can't be having PTSD from something as mild as what happened even though I have pretty much all the symptoms. I feel I'm just lying to myself. I probably just want attention. I feel like a huge fraud... How am I even supposed to ""heal"" when I'm probably making everything up, I'm probably not broken, I'm just going to get yelled at again at the new therapy place like my last one because I'll be mute every session (don't even know why, I tell myself ""because I'm not ready to talk about it"" but it's been over 5 years since the last case and all this crap is minor, so it's probably just being ashamed over doing all this crap for god-knows-why when barely anything happened to me...), because ""I'm not trying"". I don't even know why I'm posting this, probably just begging for more attention, I've pushed the last true friend I had away a few days ago over my fears of therapy.",1
"Ever since my ex and I broke up last year, I’ve been cooped up at home because I couldn’t find the courage or motivation to go out. We had been going out for 3 years when we decided to break it off. I started to work from home and further withdrew into myself… I rarely went out, even to see friends and do my chores, like buy groceries. Today, I decided I was sick of the way I’ve been living my life lately and want to make some serious changes. I chatted up my friends and organized a Ukraine ski trip with them next month.",0
"I had suicidal thoughts while working at the island. I had to cut it short and come back home. I was too sad to continue. Eddy and I reunited, and I assumed we were back together since it seemed so. When he got drunk he would literally switch back and forth to being happy and giggly to wanting to die and hating himself.",1
"My main thing lately is that everything is making me feel overwhelmed and stressed out even in non-stressful situations, just every day life. I have a good life that is a lot less stressful than most but it seems to cause me a lot more stress than it would to anyone else like my wife for example. I feel like I'm always on the edge and my head is going to explode in angry/frustration over nothing at all. I've been checked out many times, full blood work and other tests and everything perfect with my health as far as my Dr is concerned. I've always had an idea in my head that I would do anything and everything to avoid taking medications and I've been convinced that I can deal with this on my own and if I can't then I'm doing something wrong.",1
Relying on an app (that depended on wifi) for calls and texts became a hassle so I tried to get an Obama phone. I was denied because I couldn't provide a bill with my name and address on it. Of course I don't have an address: I'M HOMELESS! How am I suppose to get a job when I don't have a phone (one where I can be reached wherever/whenever). The system was designed perfectly...,1
A few years ago I witnessed an accident at this time of year and I am beginning to remember it again. At night I hear the sound and burst into tears and calm down until I hear it again and start crying. I didn’t know the person involved but I was one of the closest to it when it happened but I’m beginning to sort of enjoy the release from crying and fantasize about telling people about it. I feel guilty for this indulgence and feel like maybe I am just looking for attention. I have always had bad anxiety and mild depression so is it just that?,1
"I've been couchsurfing now for 75 days and life is getting harder at this time as money is sinking. Been getting into bad thought loops so I decided to write a blog that allows me to express my sadness through more ""happy"" words. I currently have two posts.

"Nothing major, some underage drinking, a little pot, but I wasn't a bad kid. Furthermore, I feel like I matured well and have gone on to be successful for my age (24) IMO. I've also had positive experiences with police. The resource officer at my high school was a really good guy and almost like a mentor to me. When I was 17 I was arrested when police raided a friends house because they were tipped off that there was to be some under-aged drinking.",0
"i have asked for her patient while he gets trained, but i understand her not wanting to potentially move into an  environment that disturbers her normal way of life, but thats 6 months from now. I am confident that training would fix 70% of the issues that she has with my dog. Could there be something else deeply underlying that i am missing? To me a loving and healthy relationship is one that can come to compromises and that are no winners or losers, but agreements in place to help solve issues TOGETHER . If she has trouble with compromising on a proper solution now, what will happen when it comes to or much larger life decisions like buying a house or moving to a new city.",0
"I just want my time to matter more, and I have an idea that this might help. But for several reasons I'd need to stay within my greater metro area. So do you guys have any tips, advice or life hacks from your experience? Thanks in advance ya'll. Happy trails.",0
"I’m onto new studies now, erasing my ancient life, my life related to him. That’s how i’m reconstruct myself for now. I plan to see another therapist, someone who could help me without any conditions. I just need help. Thanks for reading, it was difficult, but felt good to finally write it down :)",0
"Is it also possible that since I was so young, my mind distorted and hid these memories to make them less painful? I don't know what brought them back. I'm not in therapy nor have I been actively seeking any type of ""breakthrough"". I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 by a close friend's boyfriend, and the memories didn't come back then. What I feel right now, is mirroring how I felt then but honestly it might be worse.",1
"I was at my first party with her and I got really drunk and when im drunk i like making out with all my girl friends, not long kisses but with tongue. My boyfriend is fine with this because its girls but I eventually kissed her and it was so nice, not like any other friend. We ended up in bed making out for approximately 2 hours. We became even closer than before and we had sleepovers every friday, just her and me. We would get drunk alone together every time and then kiss more and also go a bit further for hours.",0
"I assumed she would answer the question, or she would explore my feelings of inadequacy, or she would interpret the transference. But her response instead was the title ""I am not getting into this with you"". She then went on with how she did like me, thought I was an interesting and nice person. but I do not believe that, it is too unlikely. Besides, as an addendum to her refusal to speak to my question, it seemed false.",0
"Last week I had an absolutely fantastic interview. They had a secondary and tertiary requirements that weren't in the job posting, and I fit all of them and then some. I made the interviewers go ""Oh, wow!"" when I brought up some of the stuff I've done, I've interned at the same place as one of the interviewers did, right around the same time. We laughed and go along great, and the interview was double the allotted time.",0
"To the typical bystander he looks to be in a bad way, but actually he’s happy. He had a mental breakdown over Christmas and was sectioned. Because of this the social services have been visiting him and due to their insistence of better accommodation, he has had to use his savings to buy a shed which he now sleeps in. He is profoundly proud of his self sufficiency and freedom and desperately does not want to be put in a home or helped in any way. The shed (although better than his trailer) isn’t insulated.",0
"I was working on this so hard and spent all of my money... and I just failed my driving test. Now the idea of retaking it gives me a panic attack. I started learning how to drive 4 years ago, and it was okay until I got this driving instructor. 90% of the time when I should be learning, he would be lookig on his phone and he would never point out any problems so I felt rather confident to finally try and get my license. In my country you first have to pass the test with your instructor and just then in an official institution.",1
"Over the past 6 years I've settled into a career that I'm really good at. Unfortunately I've had a slew of bosses that I had trouble dealing with. One of my biggest issues is that I'm prone to making small mistakes. They're not catastrophic, but they happen more often than I'd like. I've had supervisors that get really annoyed over these small mistakes, and they make me feel like my job is on the line.",1
"A little about them... I have a 17 year old, that is biologically my niece. My sister moved out when she was 3 weeks old and I raised her from that point. I was only 16. I have a 12 year old son that is biologically my husbands nephew, but we adopted him.",0
"Hi this is my first post here. I have complex PTSD which I have only just been diagnosed with, prior to this they diagnosed me with borderline personality disorders and bipolar which are now not correct. I believe this diagnosis is finally correct and a month  ago I decided to reduce my sertraline medication as i am paying for therapy and my medication will effect my treatment.

I don't want to lose the girl of my dreams.   ---   **tl;dr**: Amazing relationship > Weed addiction ruined relationship. Can/How I make her fall in love with me again? Any other opinions?,0
"Last week I posted about having to travel to Melbourne with my Sister who is a really nasty person, well it ended up being exactly what I feared, she was just plain nasty to me the entire 3 days. From the moment we arrived at out rented apartment, she would just do nothing but complain about me, saying that I'm so ""over dramatic"" and that ""I'm just anxious for attention"".......I mean really? I never wanted to be like this, and she has the way of making me feel like I'm a bad and worthless person. Now I will admit she has issues of her own, she has been pregnant so I can excuse her for that, but she has been like this for a few years now, I remember how I was anxious about my elbow swelling up and she said it was ""nothing"" and it turned out to be cellulitis. Ever since I came back from Melbourne, I've just been overthinking things, and when I do, it flares the anxiety right up.",1
"Well, not big but petty. Look, I live around the area of my assaulters. If I ever run into them, I wish I could yell out,” rapist! You know what you did!” I wish there would be witnesses and that they’d get to think about it. Gosh, I know.",0
"So now I'm here not knowing what to do. I don't want to call the cops because I don't want my mom to get in any trouble for her gambling habits. So I need some advice for what to do incase something like this ever happens again. **tl;dr**: My mom cuts her boyfriend because he grabbed her by the throat and I don't know what to do. **UPDATE**: After this incident with her boyfriend, my mom wants to move out of the house.",1
"So again, here I am, with no idea what to do. I don't have any particular skills, besides almost never getting fatigued, the ability to walk for hours on end without getting tired, lifting some pretty heavy objects despite my skinny figure, and a few other things. I know some Korean, and am studying Japanese, Chinese, and Spanish (self taught). The only things of value that I have anymore are my phone and laptop that I've had since I ran away, and I mainly use the wifi at work to access the internet. My only source of sleep is a 30-60 minute nap I manage to sneak in inside the changing stalls at the gym I shower at, unless a coworker is nice enough to let me stay with them for a few nights.",1
"I am absolutely terrified that the repairs are going to eat up my savings/any credit card wiggle room I’ve created. Based on what came on and how my car drove (it was pretty much fine with no weird noises, movements or anything strange), I’d say it’s unlikely but I am very, very scared. I’ve worked very hard to hold onto my money and make sure I had cushions in place in case of emergencies like this. Please, if anyone has any advice for how to keep myself calm and not panic until Monday, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.",1
"My homeless brother (50) has been trying to get a job, go to his required counseling, stay off alcohol, and stay out of jail. Last night he called me to say he is giving up and is resigned to staying homeless and living this way until he dies. He sleeps in a clean and safe shelter each night. He gets the same bed and has a locker. If he starts drinking again, he’ll be out in the cold because the shelter will not let drunks sleep there.",0
