We were hoping to call when he leaves for work today-he’s leaving in about 15 minutes. I’m really scared and I think he’ll continue to come after us even after he goes to jail so we’re probably going to have to get a restraining order. Considering we’re a financially unstable family this is going to majorly impact the way we live. We live in a two bedroom apartment so we’re probably going to have to move to a studio or anything else that’s cheaper. My brother leaves in 2 days because he has to go back to college and we need to take action when he’s here because me and my mom can’t really go against my dad (physically).,1
I always have to touch my face and trace my fingers along my body because it's so odd to know that I am real. That I am alive. I often now sit and think about what I am made of. How behind my skin is a complex make up of organs that keep my unique body and overly aware mind alive. I think how inside my skull is an organ that is thoroughly condensed and holds vast amounts of knowledge.,0
"My bf and I went to his parents place in Iowa over Christmas. Over the years, I have always known that his parents don't absolutely love me but I didn't realize that they actually dislike me until this time I visited them. His dad is a difficult person to begin with, which is well known by everyone and he kept making little jabs at me and insulting me. For example, he asked if I am a citizen and how long I have been one, I mentioned that I have never watched Harry Potter and he ""jokingly"" asked me if I was busy clubbing and talking to boys and doubted my upbringing, and when I was using my bfs phone, he asked me why I am using it and if I am reading his texts. These are just a couple examples and there are many more.",1
"While sitting on my normally-quiet front porch today, one of my unbelievably extroverted neighbors was carrying on the loudest conversation I've ever heard on a quiet street. Her conversation partners used a normal volume - she was the only one yelling words at the top of her lungs. I wanted to snap her clueless little head off. Or at the very least, tell her to shut the f$*( up. Grumpy?",1
He accidentally held my throat too tight and the marks of his affections remained on my long after he was a memory. He pulled out my tears and scared my face pale so not one person could see the marks of blood left on my neck. Then my world was dipped in white tint so no one could observe the taint behind my devastation. The color of my skin and the color of the fear were almost a perfect match although my fear was clearly a shade lighter than what was underneath. Who could know?,0
"This is good and bad... I was a STEM major before and probably would have had a challenging and high paid career by now, had my life taken a different course. However, post PTSD, I found myself extremely connected with the arts. I have intense emotional reactions to aesthetic experiences, and I think that’s largely responsible for the fact that I now work in a creative industry. I experience aesthetics in a unique way that I’m not sure resonates with the typical non-affected individual.",0
Things were so good again. Just like the beginning. Then the yelling comes back. I got really sick and had to go to the hospital and he refused to come and visit me when I was home. He told me I was dense for expecting him to come hang out with me when I have such a deadly disease (it was MRSA and not that deadly).,0
"Friends privy to the situation believe that she is just constantly keeping me on the back burner because I'm the safe option, when she isn't with somebody, or when she doesn't have anybody else. She knows I love her still, she knows I'd do just about anything for her, and want to be with her still to this day but nothing more than just an option. I always end up feeling the same in this situation though, worthless, low, wishing I was in a relationship with her.   ---   **tl;dr**: Me and ex have stayed in somewhat constant contact for 10 years, never get back together officially.",1
Is he who I would have pictures when thinking of a love interest before we started dating? Not really. He has a different style than my normal type and different interests. However he has an amazing fun personality and our senses of humor mesh really well together. Another big thing that makes us not so perfect is the fact that he got out of his “first love” relationship of 5 years one year before we met.,0
"Secondly; after 3 years of countless meds and as many strains of dank as you can think of, I finally discovered my cure to anxiety. I've heard handfuls of people say music helps but that's never been that case for me. Until tonight. I started listening to kid Cudi during an anxiety attack, I've been listening to him for a long time but never during an episode, I discovered his music helps me significantly. More than any meds I've ever tried.",0
"Everything sets me off and I'm almost having a panic attack. I'm going to my dads soon and that also makes me anxious because I'm afraid that I'm not in the mental state to go there and I want to stay at my moms but he really isn't happy when I do that. Anyway when she complains or is feeling bad I comfort her and I've never raised my voice at her even when frustrated. When she thinks I disagree with her she raises her voice, I have to talk about what she wants to in general right now because she gets impatient easily. I feel like vomiting because she also has so many redeeming factors but I don't want to lose her as a friend.",1
"We wish to teach such kids and train their family members skills so that they can also afford to take a house on rent.

"They’re out of town. I live in a pretty safe neighborhood, so I left the door unlocked for 30 minutes while I went on a run earlier. I always do that. Now I’m wishing I didn’t. Called two of my friends, but it’s late and they’re asleep.",1
They work together and I found out from a mutual friend that they're on a project together and I'm having difficulty handling it. ​ I am seeing a therapist. I am practicing self help. But this sort of thing is affecting me immensely.,1
"I don't care about compensations but I cant hold a job for health care so I go to the VA.  Like, ""we are here to make sure the military is not blamed for what ever is wrong with you"" kind of thing in my opinion. Anyways, I felt I should share some of the basic symptoms I have struggled with and the only treatment I have found that really worked is smoking indica strain cannibis at night when the child is asleep and having some relaxing time with my pets. Here are my symptoms: Panic attacks severe avoidance",0
"The fact is that it is not very common, these numbers, from where I come from] tl;dr - unable to overcome girlfriend's past. In two minds regarding breaking up. She says she will die without me [already popped up a cocktail of pills once. Nothing happened.]",1
Went to my first survivors of incest mtg yesterday. Sexually abused between 4/5-8/9. Have been crying for the last 3 hours and can’t think of anything else except how lonely and how much of a failure I’ve become. I’ve been in therapy since 19 but hadn’t disclosed to ANYONE about the sexual abuse by my two brothers. Then I was forced to disclose to my therapist the truth about the abuse when one of the brothers reached out to me one random day  saying he wanted to perform sexual acts on me.,1
"So I have a csf leak. It isn't diagnosed, but being that its pretty much the only thing(I don't have any heart issues) that causes orthostatic headaches and and the other problems im having, its probably a csf leak. If I stand for more than 10 minutes or so after I wake up I develope a horrible headache that feels like its pressing downwards, and I basically become retarded. Like I cant even walk straight. I think my vision is starting to be affected too.",1
"She angrily threw the blanket I wanted on my side of the bed and I told her that I didn't want to sleep in bed any more, so I was going to sleep on the couch. She knows that the doctors said not to do that, but she didn't seem to care, which to me is more evidence that she doesn't care that much about my health. As I was gathering up my things to leave the room, I got more heated and called her a bitch for caring less about me than the inanimate objects we own. She got up and literally pushed me. I'm not very big, and while I pushed back for a while, she eventually pushed me out of the room and slammed the door.",0
"I don't ""feel"" in this anymore, but I honestly can't tell if I just can't let bygones be bygones or if I'm looking at this objectively. If I do break it off, it's going to crush her personally AND add the awkwardness of her telling her friends and family its off. So I don't want to do it unless it's you know, really what's needed. And if I do leave, how do I mitigate someone who has threatened suicide at the action of me leaving? **edit**: Thanks everyone.",1
I feel so vulnerable and unsure of myself all the time now. I didn't think it would affect me this way. I'm so tired of eating ramen noodles and granola bars. I'm sick of seeking out the cheapest coffee shop that has wifi. I'm sick of feeling like a burden.,1
"He kept the pressure on my throat and I felt as if I was going to die or become unconscious. Erik finally let go only to hit me in my head a few times. I felt very scared from not being able to breath. Every time I tried begging Erik to stop he told me to shut up, that I was not allowed to talk. Erik used my hair as handles to bash my head on the wall at several different times throughout the attack.",1
"I e-mailed him a few times and received no response from him when I really needed one. Because of his lack of response, I was forced to drop out of school, University of [State (Go Mascots!! )], and I could not finish the quarter and now owe them much more money than before. But it is NOT entirely his fault. Yes I resent him at times, but I could have just as easily approached him about the subject and gotten everything taken care of, but my anxiety hadn't made me comfortable around them, so I couldn't bring my self to do it.",1
"I am more than my pain and I deserve that. LSD has helped me realize this. Don’t just take this willy nilly, it takes a lot of mental preparation. But the fact that I am doing more self evaluation and healing now than I have in years of therapy or whatever medication they said would make me “better” is incredible. Discuss?",0
"I know there are a lot of bad stories on here about therapy. But I was wondering about good experiences. My own experience was six weeks ago. I slipped and went on s bender, I fell into a depressive, suicidal crisis. I phoned every crisis line that exists, for ten hours, well getting drunker and drunker.",1
This is my story I feel I should share in the case things every turn bad. When I was a kid my brother use to practice the choke slam. At first it was fun but when I grew up it wasn't. My brother continue to abuse me for years . He called me names and some days I believe him.,1
"I learned how to manifest that love in actions good for my body. I cooked a diabetic-friendly meal every night - even if it was just cutting up a block of cheese and opening a package of pepperoni. I spent a little extra on tissues, found the ones I liked best - and kept boxes in every room in the house. I “splurged” on $10 bath bombs once I could be naked in the bathroom again. I brushed my hair before bed every night.",0
"I feel so worthless on those days. I guess I just needed to vent to a community that will hopefully understand, and see if anyone else had any similar experiences. I had PTSD for almost a year before going on benzos, but it wasn't until I was put on benzos (and then stupidly chose to continue a do-it-yourself habit) that my mind just happily dissociated - I barely remember the last year. PTSD often = dp/dr, benzos often = dp/dr, and benzo withdrawal (which many helpful internet sites say can last months or even years, yay) often = dp/dr. What in the fuck have I done to myself?",1
"I would like to surprise my friend with the kindness of strangers by crowd funding her vet bill. Please take a look at the [gofundme <url> I have set up. Any and all donations are greatly appreciated. Even if you are unable to donate, shares on facebook and twitter will be very helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read my request.",0
"Our dog Jett has been diagnosed with diabetes and is now in the hospital to stabilize his blood sugar. Luckily, he seems to be doing well and he will be home with us soon. Unfortunately, his bill is large enough that we just can't cover it on our own (especially with our poor financial situation). We're being evicted from our home soon and trying to find a place with this bill is just too much for us by ourselves. [To help us with the bill, we set up a GoFundMe <url>",1
"I find attractive qualities to pine after in literally everyone. So for a long time I thought I was pansexual, never focusing on the fact I lacked any interest in sex with the person. Maybe the desire to touch... But even kissing is weird for me and I back away from my husband when it gets too much... I'm also not super touch friendly, I think most.of that is my mental health and past...",0
I'm just really excited right now and I want to plan for what is best. I don't want to make a purchase out of emotions so I am coming here for some advice. It's been tough and lonely but I have been getting into the best shape of my life and I just feel a lot more confident. I know I will come out of this. Also I i realized that laundry mats is getting pretty expensive.,0
"With the help of my therapist, I've come to somewhat of a revelation. I have a very hard time feeling a sense of accomplishment, especially for ""little"" things throughout the day. Obviously something like applying for a few jobs (I'm unemployed) isn't going to give anybody the same sense of accomplishment as something like earning a college degree. But I have a hard time not feeling like I should have applied for more, I'm still being lazy, a normal person would have done more, etc. Which in turn is making me feel like crap and leading me to apply for even less jobs and get less done.",1
"I can't go into public restrooms because I freak out and dissociate with my surroundings. I can't watch certain shows because they were -on- in the hospital room. But I'm doubting myself, I'm doubting that this is real, that it happened and that I could be suffering from it. How to cope? how to stop doubting that this is happening?",1
"I beg him to let go of me so I can get my phone and call my dad. I bang on the floor and scream for help to try to get the downstairs neighbours' attention. He mocks my crying and tells me he's not doing anything to me, that I'm freaking out over nothing. We're struggling against each other, his elbow hitting my face, his arm occasionally choking me. I fight hard to inch towards my phone to get help, but any time I get close he grabs my phone and throw it out of my reach.",1
"I have no one to relate with, and if I can't get around it, I'll be eventually separated because I can't afford to fail another PFT because of it. I'm not here for sympathy about what lead to my anxiety. I want to put that out there. And I'm not sorry if anyone gets offended by my dark sense of humor. That's the only way I've found temporarily deal with it.",1
"PS: I forgot to mention and I don't know where to put this back so here it goes. Her parents have 2 big houses, I live in a 1 room small apartment. One of her brothers lived in the 2nd house of her parents and left last year so we where fixing it (it was a completely mess, we had to spend a LOT of money to make it habitable. We were planing to move before Christmas but I put all on hold for her thesis so she could focus on that. She said plenty of times that my apartment was a big issue for her because it was so small and that when we moved to her parent's 2nd house we would have a great improvement in our relationship and our life.",0
"He brought me to hang out with the two of them a few times. I'm not sure why he thinks I want to erode their relationship, this is another thing I'm still thinking about. My best guess is that my ""touchy"" ness comes off as flirting and he thinks I'm trying to take him from her? I do casually say things like ""I love you"" a lot too which just worsens it from that perspective. This is sorta horrifying to think about because I have absolutely zero romantic interest in him at all and the reason I valued our friendship so much in the first place was because there was no romantic/sexual element.",1
I was also forced (with threat of prison time) to get asleep apnea test. Fastest response from the VA I’ve ever seen. Within 36 hours I was diagnosed and set up with a CPAP machine. Matches up with my ex-wife’s thoughts that I don’t sleep more than 30 min before coughing myself awake and throwing fists. Burn pits fucking suck.,1
"I don't know if it was the campground, or if the probably former friend wanted some revenge. All of the hotels are way out of our price range in our area. We can stay a couple of nights, and our reservation at the campground ends this weekend. I will be asking for a refund of the remaining nights. I'm terrified that our kids will be taken from us for being homeless for less than 6 weeks.",1
"**Chapter 4** *The end of the Beginning* Drug free, Depression free, I had such a great time being homeless. Oh sure, there was the occasional scary moments, I almost died about 3 times that I can remember of. I almost got stuck in the middle of Northern Ontario  in the forest with nothing to drink, I had sex with a girl inside the engine of the Freight Train, Im not talking about the conductor's cabin, Im talking about the actual engine.",0
"It would take until my mid-twenties before I stopped letting people hurt me. But the trauma remains. I've become a successful professional, happily married, with a home and pets (no children, I'll never have children after what I survived). I've been out of therapy for almost 10 years but my coping mechanisms have been failing. I'm having breakdown after breakdown after the slightest trigger and there are SO MANY triggers!",1
"It's always been something I have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety. I think it stems down to the fact I had a tooth removed when I was only 5. Doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me I had to have it removed till the actual day. She just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth. Obviously at 5 that seemed pretty scary, didn't help that I had to wait 3 hours when I got there.",1
"Anxiety kicked in but then heightened by all the fucking coffee I drank from working before the meet. I started shaking, I couldn't lift my head up. My girlfriend and I stepped out for a smoke, and I told her the situation, the guys moved away... they were hot too so thanks to my anxiety I missed out yet again on another golden opportunity. But once we got back to our seats, I told my girl that I recently got close to that I had anxiety and the symptoms, just casually because at this point its just a thing I have to tell people, but this time it wasn't to a fellow artist or designer, she was a nurse. Instead of saying yeah I have it to or yeah we all get like that, she asked me further questions.",1
"I get that three mistakes in a row is nothing new, I've seen coworkers make that many in a day. I just can't shake the very strong feeling that this person may not be a safe person to be around and I have no idea if that is a helpful gut feeling or if it's a weird and new manifestation of the PTSD (I've never had this issue before, previously people only triggered my ptsd when refusing to let me leave or when being quite physically aggressive) Obviously I am going to talk to the PTSD counselor about this to see what they think but I have to decide about this appointment by first thing tomorrow (13.5 hours from posting) whether to trust them enough to keep the appointment, or to cancel it for now so I don't risk getting kicked out from appointment mixups. I'd try in a new city in a couple months when I have a stable living situation. Is there a way to gauge if someone is unsafe or if I'm paranoid?",1
As a result I had a total burn out. Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people. It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all. Her response was that a lot of people have f’d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.,1
"I feel like I am just being written off because of my diagnosis before anyone even tries to look into it and see if anything else might be at play. I'd just as soon not say anything about my PTSD to be taken seriously, but it appears in my medical records. Or when I list my medications as required, Drs usually ask me what the meds are treating and it comes up then. Has anyone else had this experience? What has worked for you to be taken seriously?",0
"There aren't a lot of people in my life I can talk to. I did have a therapist who I clicked with really well, but I had to stop seeing him when my work comp case closed. I just started seeing a new one but haven't gotten to the point where I really feel I can rely on her yet, as I've only seen her a couple of times. The crisis lines have been very unhelpful. I just need some support.",1
"60 days past due, need 1,500 by the end up business Friday, current payment and past due amount. I made a post on r/borrow and would be willing to offer same terms to anyone here. There I requested $2250, to also help consolidate some loans I have there, with a pay back amount of $2,750 over 5 months. If I lose this car, my world will collapse and I will most likely end up homeless. I'm hoping there is a kind soul on here who can help, but hope all have a blessed day!",1
"I do take a bath with febreze and alsobtake care of my teeth with toothbrush, toothpaste, floss and mouth wash. As for food, I go to the Dollar Tree (or any other store) and only buy $1 items like chips, canned goods with an opener, big bags of popcorn, etc and keep a lot of shopping bags to be used for trash bags. For drinks, luckily for me, there's a $0.25 soda machine beside the store. I also sign up for points cards cause they are very important for me to use later on. When I clean, I go nearby one of those vaccum stations, take the trash out, vacuum the mess I made, and spay febreze everywhere.",0
"My sickness couldn't be diagnosed at the time w/o insurance. I was too ill to remain in NYC so had to move home. Fast forward to Jan 2014, living with my father in Ohio-I woke up paralyzed from the waist down on the left hand side of my body (lasted almost two months). Finally got the testing I needed: diagnosis MS. I also have Fibromyalgia, OA in my knees, central sleep apnea, MDD, and other various health issues.",0
As someone in there house is no longer going to be living with them as a mutual agreement. I get along really well with some people in this agreed group and they are far more enthusiastic and keen than the others I mentioned above. I discussed with this group prior to the free slot that it would be lovely to live with them if possible and now that they have a slot it's actually possible. Since that happened I agreed to live take the slot with them. Having a house with them (five of us total) and I think it's in my best interest as they are a tight friend group meaning communication to sort it out is easier and they're more assertive - four of them are also taking the same subject as me.,0
"Meditation - I would download head space the first 10 sessions with it are free and you can decide if you want to continue or not for a fee, but it is a good starting place for beginner mediators. I started with head space but now do unguided meditation before and after I sleep. I listen to this <url> I like the elephant so that's why I chose it. If you don't like this one you can just search up unguided meditation music on YouTube or have no music up to you. But I would use head space if you are a beginner at least for the first 10 sessions",0
"I've been trying to avoid social media because I know how anxiety provoking it can be for me. I joined it ultimately because I thought it would make me feel more connected to people. It kind of does, which I'm okay with. But of course, now I'm looking at everyone's highlight reels and friend count (which I'm especially envious of) and I can't help but feel like crap. My social life came to a standstill in my early 20s when I compartmentalized all facets of my life, ensuring the people I knew never intermingled.",1
"Please, Do not hate him. Yes, he took her side so many times. You can say that he should have seen the signs or whatever, but honestly, no he couldnt have. He worked 14-16 hours a day (in las vegas heat, that is no fucking joke of a day) to support his household. She would make sure I was tucked in bed by the time he got home, and what little chances i got to see him, he would have already heard from her I was horrible some way or another and have the impression i was trying to lie.",0
"I’m going to kill myself. I can’t take this anymore. I was doing so much fucking better lately, and just like a snap of a finger, I am disassociating harder then I ever have before. It comes out of nowhere, when I’m having an other wise good day. No anxiety or depression but out of nowhere I get extremely disassociated.",1
"Or is that unnecessary? Also is there another way? I really don't want to talk about what happened. But, I really want the nightmares to go away. Sorry if this sounds weird, I am really really fucking tired...",1
"I have a short term plan, but nothing long term at all. I’m assuming she’s going to shut off my phone in the next 24 hours, so I’ll have no access to texting or calling services until fiancé can afford to put me on his plan. Unfortunately, he may lose his job because he was living with me and my mom. Today we had a really bad fight and she’s at home while I’m outside... I don’t think I can go back anymore and I have nowhere to go, with the very little money I have on me and only the vaguest sense of what to do.",1
"My best friend died last year, of a rare type of bacteria that killed him very quickly, a contagious disease. He was a year younger than me. I am still relatively young but also starting to get old, my age is in between somewhere. I can feel the medicine starting to work and I am not as anxious now. I have been typing for over half an hour.",1
"I've heard it's less activating and more calming than Zoloft, as it's the most serotonin selective. I've also heard Trazodone may be an option, for someone who wants SSRI-like-effects without any activation. Additionally, my Psych doctor mentioned Gabapentin as a way to directly target anxiety without any of the long-term concerns of daily benzo use. (though I've read it's not without its own drawbacks.) Obviously, this wouldn't have any serotonergic effect, but could be a good alternative to the Xanax.",0
"His best chance is to seek treatment abroad, in a specialised sarcoma clinic. He is a young, resilient man with huge support from his family and friends. Sean is a fighter and he just needs an opportunity to beat this cancer. We cannot accept there is no hope for Sean and wish to exhaust all options. Please help Sean to get the best shot he’s got to fight the sarcoma and get back to living life to his full potential.",0
"He's an awesome friend who has always been there for me when I had been struggling with depression, giving me great advice, and this put him over the top with this generosity. Between you guys, the three or four family members I have left that I can talk to without shaking with rage, and my friend in Indiana, I have actually cried tears of joy. Seeing people come through when I'm miserable and at rock bottom, I realize I'm not really at rock bottom when there's a hand to help me up. Thank you so much, again. I love you all ❤",0
Im positive the 2 panic attacks and the following brain fog is anxiety based because like i said I've had mild anxiety in the past and i don't think i have any other issues. Anyways i was wondering if its normal to feel spaced out and a little slow/ tired a few days panic attacks. I haven't touched weed since but i still feel spaced out. Any insight would be appreciated. I also noticed when i don't focus on my worry i feel a little better,1
"It didn't go exactly how it should have done though, and the female had to go to theatre and lost 3 pints of blood. My aim is to get my story published, and once it is selling, the money I need to initially get the book into print would be donated to research into TTTS. Over and above the £2500 donation, a percentage of all further sales would be donated to this important research. If you can please take the time to click the link below, and share what I am trying to do, I would be very appreciative. <url>",0
"She's the first person I've ever really opened up to. I haven't told her everything about whats happened, but she does know about my anxiety (which I get from my PTSD) and she reacts sportively to it. To some extent, I let me be ""myself"" around her, whatever I am. She's moving. She's moving to Maryland.",1
"People say ""follow your gut"" but I don't even know if I have a gut feeling on this anymore because I have obfuscated it so much and overthought it to exhaustion. People have told me this is really no big deal in the long run but it feels absolutely monumental to me and will be something affecting me the rest of my life. Can any of you relate? How do you make really tough, lifelong decisions like these if you have anxiety? Thank you.",1
"I’m so mad. Since April I spoke with four professors: all for course evaluations and two for letters of Rec. They all agreed and I send them the necessary documents. I just called to check the file at my university and out of all those professors, only one submitted a course evaluation. I apply for a masters in a month and have no letters, despite having periodically emailed to update these professors.",1
"He constantly threaten to take our son and I’ll never see him again. Last night, I started a journal less about the abuse and more about my feelings on a day to day basis. This morning he hide my meds from me, after an hour I woke him and asked where they were. He cussed me out and told me he not to talk to him until 1pm. Last night, he forced me into our son’s room and as I was trying to escape he slapped my wrist in the door.",1
"Hey guys. My girlfriend and I recently made a move from South Florida to Ohio for a change of scenery and a massive cost of living decrease. Due to the unexpected costs of the move and the cost of getting settled into our new home, we are severely in need of some basics to get us and our two pets through until we receive our first full checks from our new jobs. Our original dream was to move across the country to the west coast and start from scratch when we arrived. We had enough for the journey and to get us into a place, but not much else, so we reevaluated our finances and settled down in Ohio instead, about 1500 miles away from our previous home and about halfway to our original destination.",0
"The man who abused me, his mother is a political figure. I SUSPECT she is using her wealth and influence to keep her sons abuse secret. The family has been blaming me for my abuse, denying it happened, threatenung me into changing my story, and generally defaming my character. I can't prove it but suspect this may have happened to a girl before me. Is there a way to expose this family?",1
"Whats the chances of his employer asking for his certificate randomly? I feel like he cant apply to other jobs at more prestigious companies.

"For the record, my partner hasn't brought this up as an issue but of course being turned down sucks and it's been like this since the beginning. I thought with time I'd relax but it wasn't a question of relaxing. To make things worse, nine times out of ten that we do have sex is because I initiate. That is not because he never does, that is how much I turn him down. I know this seems stupid since most posts here are about how to survive but maybe a random post about improvement can be acceptable?",0
"I eventually came to accept what I went through by realising that I did nothing to deserve it, he's just a bastard. However, he got married again to a woman he's been with for a few years last week and now has a new family. They seem genuinely happy and from what I know he isn't abusing them. I should be happy for them as it means he might have finally sorted himself out but I can't help but think that he's the same person he was, and I actually did deserve it. I know it's not rational for me to think that, but I can't help it.",0
"I'm so stressed at the moment, I pretty much had a breakdown in college from all the work I need to do and the deadline is next week. I have 4 different projects in on the same day at the same time and I'm doing the best I can to manage my time but it's nothing simple like typing up an assignment. It's programming work, and as much as I do enjoy programming, having to create 4 different projects with 3 different languages is causing me to panic and stress out on getting things done. I've spoken to student support and a couple of tutors but I can't switch my mind off how many deadlines I have and the worst part is that I can't do 3 of them at home. I can only do them during college hours.",1
Im studying at a university abroad And I have failed or got a really bad grade my first semester subjects due to starting a month late and searching for accommodation for atleast 2 weeks or I would have stayed on the streets. I have been doing my absolute best to pass but the subject were very difficult on my own....I have tried studying and watching old lectures and everything but the syllabus was too long in several cases ( mathematics was much more difficult and longer than abitur according to our professor) and exams were just too hard for me in my situation so I failed. The thing is she linked this with studying with my friends which I only recently started doing it because they were very helpful and my progress increased significantly. She now commands me to just cut all relations with any friends that I have made whom for the first time in my life are ones who i looked forward to seeing them the next day because I enjoy there company.,0

"First post here, using a throwaway because for some reason I just don't want my regular reddit account attached, despite being fairly open about the fact I was raped. But I digress. In February of this year, I was raped by my (now ex) boyfriend, who also happened to be the only person I've ever had sex with. I was diagnosed with PTSD in September. The rape has flipped my life entirely upside down, and there isn't an hour that goes by where my mind doesn't screw me over with either thoughts of the rape itself or simply just HIM.",1
"So lets forget all about my biological father. My father once told me : ""Money do not fall from tree's"", but, boy oh boy, was I ever going to show him wrong. It all started with the fact that one day I got out of bed, and had the weird idea that I was going to die at 21 yrs old. I was listening to The Doors at that point, and Black Sabbath and everything in between those two. And while listening to The Doors, it opened the the doors of perception to me.",0

"We're currently looking for separate houses, haven't told the kids but my face is an absolute dogs dinner and will definitely have scarring for life. If it was the two of us, we could work it through but my relationship with G after so many telling offs, heart to hearts, explanations about his actions and their consequences, still goads me to get a rise. This is a woman who won't back down easily and will portray very intelligent coniving questions which have left me feeling dominated, under control and manipulated for a couple of years now. The one guiding light for us to work through it is my younger two children and how much I adore them. Still,in this current situation, there's is a seemingly insurmountable wall of emotions from all parties which would need a huge amount of effort to even bring us to the negotiating table.",0
"It's late and I should be sleeping but I can't get my husband out of my head, he's just such a freaking weirdo. I feel alone in my situation because most abuse involves some level of anger, but for me my suffering was just his way of showing me affection.  He would always love to wrestle and tickle torture me, and he wouldn't stop when I was screaming at him to stop I no longer live with him but even today I still get a little flinchy. I lived in fear of being tackled, pinned, and tickled on a routine basis. I resent him for making me feel so small and fearful and at the same time he made me feel like I was crazy, that I was overreacting.",1

"I had no insurance but got expensive tests run to confirm that I was not having seizures. When that therapist suggested crystal healing I left and went to another one. After over six different therapists/psychiatrists I have received yet another diagnosis of PTSD, schizophrenia with mania, anxiety disorder, and depression. The meds are not working and I live in a small town where my mental health access has been exhausted. The last therapist told me after one visit that they ""aren't really equipped to deal with people like you (me).""",1
"Quick background: I left this guy back in 2006 after three years, and also turned him in for possession of child pornography and talking to a tween online and getting nudes from her.

"Now six weeks ago, I was asked to contribute $250 to the household, great no issue. Now suddenly (this happened in the space of an hour yesterday and was never discussed with me), my rent has doubled to $500, and my boyfriends tripled to $700. As a full time student who pays every single bill herself, including school, I cannot pay this amount.

I didn't pass out this time. He went upstairs and slammed his door and locked it. I got right up and ran up the stairs and told him to let me in to get my shit so I can go.

My husband had several things happen to him when he was a teenager and occasionally when things get very bad for him he has very bad flashbacks complete with regression to the time when the trauma happened. It is heartbreaking to see, and obviously he does not recognize me and does not understand why we live together and why he’s not living at his parents house Does anyone have experience with this kind of flashbacks?

"So I met this guy about 9 months ago at a meet-up group. We used to go out for drinks every other weekend and he'd always come on to me. We ended up hooking up a few times when drunk and became sort-of friends w/ benefits. It was the first time I'd done anything like that but he seemed like a natural flirter. But after a while, some personal stuff got in the way of his life and he took a break from the drinking/partying etc.",0

Can anyone relate to this feeling? I can’t enjoy myself at things like concerts anymore. I’m not fully present because I have to try so hard to curb feelings of anxiety and hyper-vigilance.

My grandparent did a reverse mortgage, died and their home went into foreclosure, got put up for a short sale, and is now in the closing process. The relative who's purchasing the home clearly wants to profit off of the home and is warning me that in the coming days it'll be time for me to go. Unfortunately, my next stop will be a shelter as I have no money saved up to move into an apartment of my own, nor do I make enough working part-time to pay rent, and I don't have many ready available options that I'm aware of. The only question I have is does the relative have to pay us to move out or can they just kick us to the curb without a penny?",0

And if I don’t try to plough through that kind of problem, I’m letting anxiety ruin me, according to my family. I know they don’t get how real it feels when you’re sick from anxiety but I know the difference in myself. I know the difference between anxiety-sick and having an illness caused by something else.",0
"I'm 20, and just got kicked out of my grandmother's house spur of the moment. No idea why, she refuses to tell me, just started throwing things at me and told me ""It's not safe for me to be there."" I do still have my car, and I have a job so I can afford it. My question is how legal is it to do so? It's a small car, and I'm 6'8, so I doubt I'll get much sleep anyways, but if I do, I wouldn't want to get woken up by police telling me to move, or worse, getting impounded or something.",1
"Rambling about that is over. I would like to save up while doing this over the next couple of months, get my finances back in order, and pay monthly on a land owner finance piece of raw land without covenant restrictions at around $200 a month (that is a possibility in my area, at about 2 acres) and get a tiny building on it or build an earthbag home - somewhere along those lines. The only real concern I have is electricity to do the editing work, but I figure if I do the work I need to do, head to a McDonalds/park/etc to recharge, then I can do alright. I'll be able to store the DJ gear for when its not being used for free. I have a battery charger/car jumper combo I'm keeping in my car I can use for small electronics, and I'm pretty sure I'll have friends who I can see for a couple hours to charge that once a week, and see friends I haven't in years (which obviously is the best part!)",0

I've even asked her why she thinks I'm so stupid and she said ""because nobody taught you these things"" so I guess shes helping, it's just hard to know that I'm a failure.

We live together in a house with two other people. We have our own space but the common area is shared. She has expressed that she doesn't like the living situation but the fact that it is cheap and we are all locked into a lease has prevented me from making any changes.

About halfway through the first year, she began asking if I'd ever be okay with her experimenting with a girl, or if I'd ever consider her having other sex friends. She doesn't want serious relationships with them, she only wants to bang.

The second session he continued with this spending nearly 30 minutes saying I have 3 options, seeing a psychiatrist and taking pills, going to CBT to treat 'only the symptoms' or seeing a dynamic therapist like him for sessions which would take a year at least to see results.

The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year.

I don't think the users there are harsh from what I saw but I think the whole atmosphere they are preserving there (I think the moderators encourage it) is kinda unhelpful to be honest...and I think the moderators there are shady and harsh. I think some of the resources are good but I just mean the forum. I'm scared to post this here but I don't know where else would be good to ask so I'm taking the risk. It's just that they both seem to be such prominent forums for vulnerable people. So I just wanted to know if anyone else had similar thoughts about them?,0
"Even present-day situations where they are receiving love from a safe person can trigger the awareness and subsequent grief of knowing how unloved they were by comparison. Anxiety and depression are considered commonplace, but I suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. Unless they are specially certified, they might have had a few hours in graduate school on Cluster B personality disorders, and even fewer hours on helping their survivors. Many survivors of complex trauma are often misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD) or bipolar disorder.",0

"I grew up believing that everything bad that happened was my fault. I have tried so hard to make something of my life after that hell, but now that everything feels like falling apart again I feel like I am breaking.

Long story short my family in NE Ohio is abusive as hell so I had to leave the state and stay with family down south. It isn't working out and they're sending me packing to Ohio because I guess I'm a financial problem even though I got a job here. I have nowhere I can stay. I'm even getting rid of my beloved cat so I can have options. I can't go back to my family in Ohio.,1
Every rational part of me believes I'm retroactively terrified of the fact I almost didn't get to live the life I'm living now. I wish I wouldn't think about it. But I just keep doing it. It's like I get some sick thrill out of the fear and anxiety like it's a horror movie or rollercoaster. I know I shouldn't be feeling that way about it but I am and I don't know why or how to stop it.,1

My therapist says this is a normal behavior to display. Having been ripped from my children and left on the streets is very hard and i honeslty want to give up.

Everyday I was told how worthless I was and was getting beat regularly. However I coped with it. At the start when I came to England, I was crying all the time, when I was called stupid, and idiot or was hit by a friend (A kind of a friendly abuse, you know when you just want to annoy your friends).

My youngest never remembered her dad’s abuse, and is very upset that she doesn’t get to see him. My oldest remembers a bit more, but was not the victim most of the time, and also feels a little mad. It’s hard to talk about divorce without having the conversation about their dad, and it’s even harder to explain to them why they can’t see their dad.

"It's also frustrating because I'm finally getting the kind of help I would expect from family and BEYOND from a woman I met while panhandling this summer. Thanks to a stranger: I've been able to finally get mental health assistance, I got my benefits fixed, I got a job, and I have a safe place to sleep out of the rain or snow. I have somewhere to leave my pack and bed roll rather than carry it around 24/7. I could probably ask to store that stuff, but it seems so asinine to ask more of this woman and especially so since it's just extra supplies for my dog I don't really need. I can't understand why even the bare minimum is too much to ask of the people who are supposed to care the most.",0

When my SO and I first started dating and she told me she had PTSD I though just being a good guy would be enough. Well just being a good guy is not enough when your with someone with PTSD. You can still trigger them even though you are a good guy. You can still get offended when they tell you they can't trust you even though it is the PTSD talking and not them. You feel like a failure when they tell you they feel hopeless and that nobody can help them.,1

"That night wasn’t so great for me as I felt ignored because both of the guys (my bf and the mutual friend) were mostly having conversations with her, leaving me to trail behind. I thought maybe it’s because we were “hosting” her and because she’s on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to us - as in, she’s into things and engages in those things we’re not necessarily into, but are interested in and could hold a conversation about. Anyway, over the course of our relationship my bf would still bring Sally up occasionally, how they were going to hang out with other coworkers. Of course, I’m totally okay with that and I encourage him to be social when he can!

"I have been thinking about it and I think that all anxiety seems to boil down to either fear of what other people think of you or fear of death. I am curious if this is just me? Sometimes simplifying it makes it easier for me to deal with, at least during less intense moments where I still have control of my mind.

I even thought this didn't affect me, I thought most people go through either the same or worse, until I was about 20 years old.

Today I logged on to my computer to have a few games with friends that I know. Before the games started I got into a discussion with a friend and a few points to take away from the conversation were: - People don't know how to react when I'm around because I'm overly sensitive. - People don't have the persistence to continue trying to help. - They don't feel like they can help so they've been avoiding me.,0

The typical “I can fix this” response that colours victims of abusive partners - and having been one, it is especially demoralizing to see him having to go through this for the sake of avoiding both change and a failed marriage. What can I do to help him, besides support him emotionally, and eventually have him realize for himself that this is not normal? tl;dr: my [25F] partner [30M] is being abused by his wife [28F], but is convinced to keep trying to make it work despite the situation detrimentally affecting his own mental health.",0

"An app made sense for this, since so many people have a phone. But sometimes a solution can raise more problems! If we had an app that says ""domestic violence escape plan,"" and if the abuser checks the user's phone, that's even worse than a paper form. So here's the solution we came up with: the app is ostensibly a ""quote of the day"" app, just like so many others. You open it up and it just looks like any other, with inspirational quotes (carefully chosen to be relevant without appearing relevant, by the way).",0

Everyone loved him. He told the best stories and cooked the best food and was funny. All my friends thought he was the coolest person ever. He also has untreated bipolar disorder. Anyway - back in December he hit her so bad (using an object) that the next day she passed out at work and her coworkers forced her to get medial attention ) - she went the hospital - her sister went to meet her - and because it was mentioned that a minor lived in the house - social workers and the police got involved.,0

My sister lives with her BF and my 2 year old nephew about 30 minutes away from me. A few days ago she asked if her and my nephew can come spend next Monday - Friday with me because her BF is going out of town and she doesn't want to be in the house alone without him (they live with his family so I guess sometimes it gets uncomfortable). I said okay sure. I live in 500 sqft a studio but I have a pullout couch in addition to my bed. I've been with my BF for 3 years and about 5 months ago he unofficially moved in with me (unofficial because we share bills and all of his stuff is here but his mail and whatnot still goes to his parents where he was living before).,0

The sexual requirements were a very stringent hygiene ritual, followed with putting on one of his idol videos and I would dress as whatever the girl was wearing such as a maid costume or whatever. He would keep his eyes on the screen while I basically gave him a blow job. Very rarely he would have sex with me, I suppose because it would mean having to look at me more than the screen, so he'd prefer just a blow job.",0

I'm a 30 years old straight dude who started struggling with anxiety when I started to think I was gay (now I know this thing is called HOCD, but at the time I even came out as bisexual to my mother). After I went to therapy hoping to accept my sexuality, I discovered my problem wasn't self acceptance but an anxiety disorder, so that made sense, because I came out as bisexual even though I don't feel attracted to men.

"When she was an infant, she would play with her when she was told to leave her alone. She would do things she wasn't supposed to. She often acted like Grace was her child. It didn't help that Anna is mature looking at 5'8"", and was often asked if Grace was her baby. Around when Grace was 18 months, I got asked less and less to watch her, and Anna was doing it.",0
He's in a group of people. The problem is that because of what happened to me (police brutality/stalking) the general public think the police are the good guys and are not understanding when I give them explain that's not always the case.

I appreciate any insight or experience y'all may have with seeking treatment.,1

"She never messaged him back, but I asked her why she still had him on Snapchat. I only asked it because she had claimed to have deleted her ex's on social media. Whatever, that's a nice feeling and I'm glad, but at the same time it wouldn't really be an issue for me if she did still have them. Fast forward to last night... My fiance was acting all weird and put out so I tried figure out what was going on and what she was upset about.",0

"So I have a buddy who still lives with his step dad, mom, and brother. Long story short, I just found out through him that his step dad hits him and occasionally his mother. It came out when he was drunk along with other behaviors. When my friend gets drunk he likes to aggravate people until they try to beat him up and until recently I just thought he liked fighting. But he told me it is because his step dad hits him so getting in fights gives him a weird sense of worth.",0

Ok so firstly I should say she hasn't been formally diagnosed but it's at this point a logical conclusion that she's suffering some kind of ptsd from a rape that she endured a couple years back. It was before I knew her and when we met she seemed to be pretty stable. Although I know now that's not the case. I do not blame her at all for this behaviour but I really need help understanding her before I get hurt worse than I already have. Going forward keep in mind 2 things:,0
"I can't tell if that's me being a toxic person or not, and I feel guilty for feeling relieved. We were such good friends once, but I have to admit we hadn't talked about art or writing (the things that made us friends) for years. My anxiety has muddied the waters, and maybe all my shit and all my emotional abuse crap did ruin everything and it was all my fault. Maybe I did end things because I'd felt blamed for 2 months straight and just wanted to get away from the anxiety it was all causing me. Maybe I should have been the one to grovel, because I'd fucked up so bad over the situation.",1

"My mom was not a very good emotional support for my dad. He is very sensitive and touchy-feely, whereas she will take something at face value and not pick up on subtleties. I think they had a somewhat loveless marriage, and my dad turned to me as an emotional outlet at some point in my early teens. He would spend hours talking to me about lessons on morality, his suffering at the hands of my insensitive/clueless mom, and his love of all things romantic and sensual.

I was sexually abused as a teen, and since then advocating for myself -especially in sexual situations- is really difficult for me. But today I had a guy come over and, when he tried getting off without using a condom **even though he agreed to use one not five minutes before,** I punched him several times off my bed and then a few times more while he was standing up (he's almost double my weight).

"Therefore, it should probably come as no surprise that I sprung the question of ""What exactly are we doing here?"". Well, that backfired, as he alluded to the fact he was too freshly out of a long term relationship and didn't want to commit yet (Jason had been single for more than a year and it was a 3 year relationship). I bit my tongue until it bled and told him that was okay because we had more friends in common by that point, despite saying I needed some direct space for a few weeks or more. Unfortunately, what followed could have not been more violent. Not the type of physical violence, but emotional tension and turmoil fueled by running into each other at social settings and by alcohol.",1

Hard because they still want to see each other.,1

One time while trying to avoid his chokes I cut my head so bad that blood was gushing all over the room - and when I got him off me, he came back and headbutted me in the nose and tried to choke me again, after which I threw him over the table.

So as the title says, I have a friend who is currently struggling with severe depression. I care very much about her and am very concerned for her well-being.",0
"I then confronted my parents and finally the walls came tumbling down. It wasn't the first time I asked them about it, I did so on at least 3 different occasions throughout my twenties. Well after 2 weeks I got written confirmation, when my parents handed me a note from 1986, where they wrote down, what I told them, when I talked about it afterwards again and again. I addition to this, the memories came back from when I was about 12-15, when my parents used to lock me up in my room and bathroom and made me learn my latin vocabularies on my knees, only being allowed to eat, when I was finnished. That was something I kinda always knew happened, but I thought it was just on a few occasions and well - I was such a rascal, how else could they have handled me?",0
"I'm not exaggerating in that I legitimately, 100%, thought I was going to die. I don't think I've ever been so scared. I keep a diary and reading back on what I wrote at that time makes me cry at the memory. Something else new I've been experiencing is numbness. I've never felt numb before but it's been happening more lately.",1
"I got a fair amount of interest on Facebook (though og course a lot of people didn’t follow through) one lady (F 40’s or early 50’s) liked my post and sent a friend request. I accepted even though I don’t know her because I thought she might be interested in the team. It turns out she is very well connected in the horse word here and knows a lot of people I know (and seems very popular). Well, fast forward to now and this woman has posted all over about her starting an adult drill team. Her team is within 20 minutes of where my drill team would be, and so all the people who were interested in mine seem to have gone to hers (I think because she’s a connected horse person here).",0
This isn’t so much a cry for help but I just want to rant about all my problems somewhere and this seems like the place. I’ve had anxiety for a few years now but this year I’m full on depressed. I’ve considered running away so many fucking time but I always feel bad for those I’m trying to leave. I’ve never self harmed (thankfully) but I’m always bummed out and paranoid. College is surprisingly the only thing that doesn’t make me anxious.,1
"I mean that type of behavior is just weird, I don't understand how someone can still hang out with their friends every day almost like theyre in high school. His job is kind of low demand (bartender and has an internship at an office) so i guess he just has a lot of free time... but still. What am I supposed to think?   ---   **tl;dr**: Boyfriend hangs out with his friends constantly and im worried this is a sign of immaturity.",0
"Please don't make me feel worse. I mean, hell, I'm ashamed I even need to ask my boyfriend. But at least we have things to talk about and he's just naturally good at keeping me calm without even realizing he's doing it. He actually *helps* by being there. My mom and sister either do nothing or make it worse.",1
"and i still feel like im on meth 5 days later after sleeping less then 10 hours total over that time. im also going in and out of depersonalization and derealization when it gets really bad, and when i haven't done the twitch for a few hours I can start feeling really tired and depressed like my body needs to rest, only to do it again and instantly be jacked up and on a speed high again. this is honestly the most fucked up situation i could ever imagine and can  barely believe its even happening its so fucked up. literally feels like a bad dream. Please help",1
"So something happened over 3 years ago that caused me a tremendous amount of anxiety, and over the past few months the anxiety surrounding that event has come back? It doesn't make sense, I can't rationalize it either. This time around it's not as intense as it was then but I'm definitely experiencing the same thoughts, same anxiety. What the f do I do? I don't feel comfortable at all talking about it with a therapist and it's began consuming my life again.",1
"Most mild of it was my dad used to hit my butt and call it a love tap, I told him not to do that and he’d say “you’ll understand when you are older” Like I said this is mild and I don’t think constitutes and sex abuse, but I was absolutely uncomfortable and my boundaries were crossed hardcore. I told my dad I wanted to play football when I was 8. He told me I should try for the lingerie league instead. My mom used to go clothes shopping for me, and he would tell me to wear the opened back and low cut shirts because “that’s what the boys like” even though I didn’t want to One night he walked into my room completely naked and turned my light on, I woke up and he stood there for about five seconds completely nude, and then turned the light off.",1
and when my mom tried to ask him where the rest of the money goes he said its up her ass 🙄 real fuckin mature. i cannot fucking stand him. first he had the audacity to try and act like the victim and now he’s straight up refusing to help us or tell us what the plan is. we’re dependent on him cause we got a lot of animals and neither my mom nor i can drive. please someone give me anything im begging here my patience is near nonexistent at this point,1
"They have lives outside the group and are often coming from far away to go to this group. Should I try and be friends with them? I feel like they're not going to want to hang out with a dorky 23 year old, and I have no idea what we'd even do anyway. I also tried Bumble BFF to make friends but found the constant swiping and texting to be really boring and depressing. There's only so much bland small talk a person can make.",1
"I suffered a concussion a month ago and I noticed it really has provoked my anxiety to be scared about getting worse and it has even led to me getting depressed and thinking of harming myself I have been like this before, I have had anxiety but not to this level. I have felt better since the concussion has healed but I am worried I won't recover from my anxiety and I have been perscribed Celprix (Escitalopram) and unsure if I should take it. I kind of feel like I can recover from this by getter back to my routine and return to work. Anyone else been through a life changing injury and had some bad anxiety from it?",1
"Next, I'll get nice and comfy and ready to sleep in a position where I can feel my heartbeat. Then, I'll start listening hard for my wristwatch. At first it's difficult to hear, because your mind is focusing on your heartbeat, but after a little while you adapt and your heartbeat stops being the center of your attention. Works for me really well, and I've been able to fall asleep in any position since. Hope it works for some of you.",0
"The new man almost immediately moved to the flat previously shared with her ex, which I found strange, but I know she cannot be alone, perhaps because of her troubled childhood/daddy issues. She later confessed she was completely out of her mind in this period, and she would not do it if having a clear head. They never really ended contact, despite all the hurt. She even met with her ex after 3 months apart, confessing she misses him and cried. Since then things between them got complicated.",0
"Living with her parents has since become untenable. Her parents have taken her car, which is not under her name, and are kicking her out of the house. She needs both a short-term plan to do minimal damage to her current career and academics, as well as a long term one to find an apartment or suitable living space. At this time, I do not believe she has any existent options for roommates. 1) What resources can she call upon to help her?",0
"My husband and I live in an apartment that gets super cold easily. Part of that is because there's no protective trees in the winter, with the other problem being the buildings are run down, and there's lots of cracks around the door. My husband was able to fix a gaping crack with our door frame, but we still need more work done and management is not the best. Our heaters are old baseboard heaters that can heat the home, but run up our electricity bill like crazy. With the onset of early winter here in the midwest coupled with the loss of my husband's job, I'm going to go apply for LIHEAP, but I'm wondering if anyone knows of any other ways to keep the apartment warm.",0
I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here. I bawl every night because I don't want to feel this never ending pain anymore. I can't live with what happen to me. I can't live with the fact that since I didn't go to police that he is preying on another girl like me. I have so many social problems I dont have friends anymore.,1
"I desperately need a car and found a great opportunity but the previous owner died of a heart attack in it. Thats my number one cause of anxiety, the fear of heart attacks. He was relatively healthy and young. I feel like a big idiot for not taking it. But I have vivid nightmares of me having heart attacks then I wake up with a panic attack that lasts hours.",1
"She was really worried about being retraumatized by her birth. At the time I didn’t understand trauma or realize how deep her problems were (since I hadn’t seen them much), but I always listened to her first and foremost. We paid out of pocket for a home birth with a backup hospital plan at her parents’ house. The birth was precipitous (very fast, only a few hours) and extremely traumatic and painful. No pain medication, and I think the speed of the birth makes it more traumatic, and our son had his hand over his head when he came out.",0
I don't feel like he's in love with me and I question my feelings for him. I don't know if I'm being clingy or he was being cruel and I'm overreacting. I don't know if my numbness is caused by other stress in my life. What do I do. **,1

"I've ""enjoyed"" (didn't dislike, double negatives, oof) the jobs I've had, and some were pretty good - the people like me, so I had no reason to leave. What is the equivalent of my best friend has also gone so far as to label me as a psychopath..:/ I'm just looking for similar experiences and mostly understanding of the situation (maybe guidance in what kind of people to aim to talk to, or maybe steps to take to help in diagnosis, etc) - so far in my life every single person has pretty much told me to harden the ""f"" up and get the heck over it. Thanks.. **Edit 2** I forgot to say that my father is a completely different person now - but when I see him so much as take a sip of alcohol it all floods back to me and I get extremely terrified and nervous.",0
"Only 7 years ago at the age of 9 I think I peaked in life. I was possibly the most fun kid in class and had no problem socializing with others. Used to be so happy then. Now I’m just known by everybody as the quiet guy who rarely ever smiles. Interacting with others (especially girls) is so hard, and I’m always so conscious about how I look.",1
"I’m in Florida, can’t find concrete laws that apartment companies will let me off lease because of abuse. As in me getting my name off lease and him staying here. My fiancé is mentally and emotionally abusive. We have had some physical altercations, like him pushing me down, poking me hard in the chest, him ripping off his shirt and than hitting me with it. He’s also broken a few pairs of glasses, a remote control, smashed the hell out of his iPhone, and threw a chair across the room almost hitting his dog.",1
"I am so ready to be better. Can I work through the CBT WORKBOOK alone? Has anyone tried? I’ll kick my search into high gear this week,  broadening my search to cities near me. I just want to do something positive before I do something I regret...or wake up in 6 months having done nothing..... which is worse?",0
"Especially always being tired which just adds to the anxiety. I'm having some trouble falling asleep atm (and staying asleep which is even worse) and thought that maybe typing my thoughts out would help relax my mind and help me see my problems from a different perspective. I know things will get better, because they always do, but its still difficult to deal with the anxiety. I meditate regularly, but if anyone has any other suggestions in dealing with anxiety during bed time I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks (:",1

"I'd like to note that I have had a couple close individuals look at my emails, evidence, etc since the last court date. I'm not that crazy, but I showed them the emails because I wanted to make sure they were real. The emails, evidence, and notes are all real. I checked my phone history, and the phone calls to the advocate and office are all logged and sufficient in length to indicate that an actual conversation occurred. I never doubted reality before the abuse, and I have never done so outside of the abuse.",0
"I would like to have a relationship with his parents in the very least and let them actually get to know me, but he really doesn't want to introduce me to them. It's important for me to develop a relationship with my SO's family, especially if we intend on being long term. I don't see how we can continue our relationship like this. My question is, what can I do to improve the situation? What conversations do I need to have with my BF?",1

How should I proceed....Call Social Services and turn him in? or call the police next time he harasses me?",1

"Hello r/anxiety. I've dealt with GAD for decades, and have benefitted greatly from therapy and medication. After years of taking Paxil, I've gone *without* medication for the last couple years. It's been mostly ok, but my symptoms are annoying enough that I'm considering medication again. After consulting with a psychiatrist, it seems like an SSRI or SSNI is still my best bet.",0

I have been looking for a new job, staying at this one because I have a good boss and because it pays above minimum wage. People effortlessly walk all over her, and though she gets mad about it, company policy as well as her personal precedence, has really tied her hands. I'm one of about three reliable people, and get saddled with the shifts no one bothers to show up to.",1
"If they weren't done he would get angry at her. After that he would borrow money from her while he was making a lot of money. Instead of paying her back, he would spend both his income and her money on things he wanted. The next thing was that he would say things like ""I'll do this for you but you'll owe me a blow job later."" While that worried me the next sign really made me concerned.",1
I have had two or three or more reoccurring dreams of me cheating on my boyfriend.. and they are so real that I actually feel awful when I wake up or like it actually happened.

"I'm 29 and I've just committed to moving into a shared apartment in my city centre. I've never lived in a place like this before because it's an en-suite with my own double bedroom and bathroom, but the kitchen and lounge is shared with about 15 other 'profressionals' It's right in the centre of a bustling city near all the bars and music venues. I've always lived in the suburbs but I've always felt a bit disconnected from everything because most of my (limited) social life takes place in the city centre. But now I'm scared because I'm such an introvert and there's going to be lots of people around all the time and I'm worried I've made a mistake. Another big worry of mine is that my ex best friend lives just a few streets away from where I will be living and we are going to be sharing the same supermarket etc.",1
"The contract with Apex is over and they screwed me hard. I don't have another job lined up despite having never stopped looking, and I was counting on my income taxes to pay back all the people who I borrowed money from and buy me some time to get a proper job and fix all of this.

"I go from living happily, almost as if that part of my life didn't happen, to being floored by pain. I feel guilty to myself for how strong the reactions are so many years later. I feel guilty to my partner who has to deal with it even though he's not the one who caused me this hurt. He's been nothing short of wonderful, but I'm scared my past will end up driving him away. I certainly wish I could get away from me sometimes.",1
"Earlier that day I was talking to a customer, a male who later asked for my number. I was very flattered as this man was absolutely gorgeous and had muscles that must have been sculpted by Kratos himself, but alas, I wasn’t able to give it as it was company policy. Little did I know that Pedo had been watching me from behind a clothing rack, and soon pulled me aside in front of all my coworkers in my retail section and spoke so sternly to me, he said “this is why your life is so messed up, this is why everyone here thinks you’re so easy.” And he stormed away from me. He later radioed to me telling me to sell the cards, and after I got to 15 cards to re fold everything in the women’s section. He later texted me telling me he expected me to be at the movies that night, as to not let down the team.",0
"I tried to tell her what I was changing and why, but she just shrugged it off and started to fall asleep. It really bothered me because I was genuinely trying to help her. Overall, I am really conflicted about this whole ordeal. When we tell her things she doesn't understand or want to hear when it comes to jobs, she blows up on us.

"Mushrooms, LSD, and DMT have  been the most effective means for me to solve my anxiety. If you choose to consume these drugs however, please be aware that these are powerful psychoactive substances that can have repercussions on your mental well being. Physically, they are incredibly safe. Personally, they allowed me to view my life free from the ego, which let me adopt a healthier mindset.

"She said she always had to message first, and she decided to completely blank me when I apologised, and that was that. The first girl to ever express proper interest in me in my life ends up going completely down the drain. I don't know if it was because of my own management of messages or me being unattractive in general, but despite this great date occurring I only feel absolutely awful because of it in the end. Oh, and to rub salt into the wounds I even noticed she unliked my profile picture of all things. Ouch.",0

But now that we're close to the point of no return, with a flight booked so he can come see her(I agreed to travel out of our house for the week), and they seem to be bonding big time(I love you's abound), I'm not sure what to do with myself. On one hand I want to let loose and detach, let her have fun, and do so myself. If it leads to a new LTR for her, awesome. But what kills me I guess is the uncertainty.",1
"I was a little confused at what they meant so her husband decided to meet me and talk to me about what was going on. The way that he put it, he was saying that my husband wouldn't get physical from what he could tell, but there are boundaries that he passed. Unfortunately, he couldn't provide any examples because he couldn't remember what was said, but he could remember the feeling that he had, and it was disgust. This was during the holiday season when their company had an influx of new people and they would be gone within a few weeks because the work they do is very physical and not a lot of people can handle it. My friends husband told me and quote, ""There's friendship, there's flirting, which he did but its innocent because everyone flirts, but then there's certain boundaries that you don't say to someone else while being in a commited relationship or marriage with someone else and he was doing that.""",0
He keeps going back to her. He even cleans up the messes she makes when she smashes his stuff. He has dropped all of his dreams because she doesn't approve of them. Sorry for the long post but it sucks hearing that he is in this situation and we just want our friend back so he can recover from this. He used to be the funniest and happiest guy around and now he is just broken.,1
"Last week it happened so many times in one trip I decided to go to urgent care about it (at one point I was driving with my window down, in hail, slapping myself in the face to stay alert). Anyway, I figured I would share what I learned in case anyone else is experiencing this. Apparently nothing to do with asthma, actually caused by PTSD. After vitals were normal, the doctor said that when I drive for awhile, my body's posture is activating my sympathetic nervous system. Apparently, your nervous system has two parts; sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS).",0

Looking back now, I know this was naive and innocent on my part, nothing that anyone could or should blame a young kid for, as I really thought I was an outcast amongst my peers. And while it may have been true, there is no reason or excuse for a 27 year old man to want to be with a 16 year old girl except that he couldn't find a woman his age who would fall for his games and lies...

I googled it and it says that that specific program is for a very different demographic living in group homes.

"I’m fairly new at directly helping the poor. Been creating bags to give out that has food, bandaids, nail clippers, tooth brush and toothpaste, small shampoo and bar of soap, and some items are gender or age specific. But what else would you suggest? I’ve heard of gloves and socks but not sure where to get them cheap and in bulk. I want to create at least 100 bags and do it a few times per year.",0
"Attachment and a secure base are the two things a PTSD survivor does not have. Fixing that is key in their recovery. It allows survivors to reconnect with family and the world at large. &nbsp; Social level: Sachs-Ericsson & mates all the way back in 2002, go figure, found that individuals with service dogs were less isolated socially and felt more comfortable when initiating social interactions with others, also increased a survivors social desirability (note also that Henry & Crowley 2011 found that a survivors sense of self-worth as well as murturance were enhanced exponentially by having a service dog).",0
"My husband (29m) and I (26f) live across the country from our parents and have been there almost two years now. I don't really have a relationship with my inlaws (mf 65ish) (ie they never reach out to me expect for once to ask what to get my husband for his birthday and rarely talk to my husband, they don't ask about me or don't seem interest when I'm brought up) and it doesn't bug me because they are incredibly negative and angry people. My fil has anger issues and will have a meltdown in public (he's done it several times in front of me) and my mil is self absorbed among several other issues. I don't want to get into every story, and man do I have some stories, but i guess it's important to know that I've been warned about their general attitude and behavior from others and everyone who has met them that I'm friends or family with has agreed with me that their son is the source of their happiness and they feed off of each others negativity. However, they've never been out rightly malicious towards me.",0
"She also told me that I was an idiot for wasting my life, or attempting to end it anyways. I came out of that appointment in tears. That was a horrible day and I still think about it. It made me feel like I had nothing to complain about. Its only taken me until the last couple of weeks to finally accept that I did nothing wrong.",1

"I'm in need of quick assistance to make a purchase at a store next door to my condo. I planned on splitting an items cost across two cards and paid $3.40 on one card and went to put the rest $1.60 on my other card which shows it has the balance and more available but is declining for some reason. I would appreciate it if someone sent me $1.60 via google wallet, as it should transfer over within minutes allowing me to make my purchase. And in return/or before, I will send you $1.60 via bitcoin. At the current rate bitcoin is going, that amount should continue to increase in value.",0
"Now the past week, anxiety has hit harder than it's ever hit before. I'm checking snapchat scores, social media activitiy, last active etc which i know is already grounds for unhealthy relationships. The problem is when we were together, and whilst we were texting chat its absolutely perfect until the past week. The texts are shorter, my messages are being ignored (she's online but not reading my message) for hours on end, there's no good night / good morning message, it's all very limited and short. I've tried to challenge her on it as a means of settling my anxiety but this was met with a touch of hostility, in that 'yes everything is fine, i don't need to be in constant communication with you,' but I'm just so concerned that she's pulling away or losing interest and its all falling out of my hands.",1
Is it normal to feel hopeless and scared that i won't find love again? tldr: got cheated on a bunch and dumped because i cried on Christmas due to a breakdown re: being cheated on all the time and feeling worthless. scared about finding love in the future. Apologies for the mess. I've been talking myself out of writing this for a couple weeks now.,1
"3 days before, she called me, pretty upset, to say that she didn't feel able to come. Naturally I've learned that she suffers from panic attacks occasionally, and has also said that she is reluctant to try a full relationship because of worries that I'll outgrow her or find someone else (we HAVE gone on dates since she has said these things). Eventually I put the pieces together and began to understand her a little better, but I also have my own neurological obstacles that have affected my thinking with this girl. I'm going to do my best to lay them out now: -Like I mentioned, I have ADHD in a serious way.",0
"She is very sweet and I love her immensely. I can't leave her where I am currently for fear of her being neglected. She is very attached to me. I will have no choice but to live in my car for the foreseeable future, which leaves me with the issue of what to do with her. I can't keep her locked in my car all day.",1
"One instance was last year when I graduated from college. There was something in me that couldnt believe and accept that I’m finally done with college. Fast forward to today, next week will mark my 1st year anniversary at work. Part of me wants to enjoy it with my parents, co-workers, and friends but another part of me wants to just forget about it and spend it as an ordinary day. Anything I should do?",0
"I've been seeing the same one since then, and she'd helped me process so much, help me recognize and start to move past a lot of things... I went from hating and fearing my father (since the incident with my sister, which had ended up triggering the memory of being told that I was to blame for the marital issues, among other things) to the point I couldn't even be around him at family or friend gatherings without feeling anxious and wanting to flee, to being able to accept the things that happened in the past, and remind myself that they are in the past, and be able to interact with him again, even if I don't really feel any familial love for him anymore. I care about him, his wellbeing, but...  That familial bond isn't there, he killed it the he came to retrieve his stuff, a couple days after walking out... The only time I ever stood up to him. He made some snide remark about my mother, and I told him to go ahead and run from his problems like he always does, and he backed me into a corner and shook me, screamed over me when I collapsed, until my mother came home and made him leave.",1
"I was left to hold the burden of explaining to other people why he wasn't talking to them, or why he said something hurtful. I was okay with that. But I told him on many, many, very blunt occassions, 'I am not okay with just sucking your dick. I feel like you aren't putting in the effort with me and I feel sick and uncomfortable doing this.' I said this in a variety of forms as well as having panic attacks - not anxiety attacks, full-on violent shivering, mute shut-down, crying, overstimulated, feeling like you're about to die panic attacks - most of the times when we were intimate.",1

"2. We were long-distance for a few months although we visited each other almost every weekend. In that time she was very jealous and controlled my movements because she thought I was doing something with very girl who looked at me. In that time-frame, I took to hiding pictures that I had with friends who were girls, especially ones she was especially jealous of. Nothing sexual, just selfies on a night out or whatever.",0
"For many years I visited her and asked if she please could do things to mitigate my allergies (keeping the cat out of ONE room-where I slept, not give me clothes to wear that the cat had laid on, vaccuuming) and she did not do anything. ""The cat almost never wants to be in that room"" I got as a reply, but he was free to roam everywhere. A few years ago I just stopped going to their home and after taking that control I have felt much less sad about this.  - Since she got together with her new partner I wanted us to go on a short trip (weekend) staying somewhere over night with her.

"She told me she had one more person to interview and that she would get back to me by Monday. I shook her hand and rushed out the store to another place and went to their restroom. I ruined my hair, I popped a little of my collar and unbuttoned some of my dress shirts. I added some water stains and even took advantage of a partially full cup of soda in one of the stalls. I spilled it on the rims of my shirt but not entirely.",1
This has made me really question where I am and if I should be staying put. Sort of if where I was was right I wouldn't be feeling like this is now. I'm not thinking I should leave for the sake of being single to see someone else but maybe if I'm not as happy as I thought I should be leaving for me to have some time and space to do things on my own.

"so i finally got tired of being anxious and depressed, crying daily, not leaving the house a few months ago and decided it was time to see a doctor again. I would only leave to work, and couldnt hold a job very long due to the anxiety(eventually stop going after successfully alienating myself from everyone) and went to see a psychiatrist. He started me on 40mg of fluoxetine and 50mg atenolol a day with 1mg lorazepam 3x daily as needed. I averaged about 2 of the lorazepam a day, some days 3 some days 1 or even 0, and 1 time i took 4(christmas with the family, not all at once but over the course of the evening) I went back after about 2 and a half months and he increased my atenolol to 100mg and switched me to .5mg alprazolam 1x a day(from the past i knew this wouldnt be an effective dose but he wouldnt listen) For the 2 and a half months i felt like i was leading a normal life, doing well in school, seeing friends again, working, going on dates(have a girlfriend who understands my anxiety and we met when  i was drinking to deal with it so this is the worst shes ever seen me and wants me to find a new doctor) interacting with my family and not hiding in my room all day.

Now that I know more about him and met his family, the more determined I felt to make this relationship work.",0
"When I was younger, not even double digits, another minor around my age came very close to sexually assaulting me. It luckily didn’t happen and my two cousins busted the boy’s door.

"I was very interested but she kept saying ""Don't go! I want you here!"". I decided to say to hell with it and went.

The feelings weren't gone but they were buried under everything she had filled my mind with.",0
"Am I being way overdramatic? Hope I provided enough information. I truly tried not to sound angry or overly upset.   ---   **tl;dr**: My mother has hit me quite a few times, put my clothes in trash bags when I don't clean them on time, won't let me lock my door, and has threatened to take away the car I drive that they paid for (and therefore job and access to classes).",1
She is so hardworking. At multiple times in her life she has worked multiple jobs to support herself and her family. She has never been on any type of government assistance. Even when she divorced her abusive alcoholic husband she didn't seek child support or alimony. She is incredibly self sufficient but it just seems that she can't catch a break.,0
"I clearly hold it to such high regards... I would think, ""no one's this stupid"" but apparently people are. If anyone is wondering why i didn't ignore it, I thought I wasn't being clear in what I was saying and thought if I just bluntly told it, it would understand and go away. When I kept saying it wasn't listening, for some reason, I believed I wasn't communicating clearly or I was being ""too nice"" by ""hinting at it"". Turns out abusers do this thing where they deliberately don't listen to people calling them out.",0

"When I asked her how it happened, she said her brother had accidentally elbowed her in the face when they were 'rough-housing'. There was something about the way she said it that seemed a bit off to me - like she had been practising her excuse (or maybe that was in my head). Whatever the case it struck me as maybe a little weird that a couple of 20-something siblings would be play-fighting with each other like 10 year olds. This morning, after an absence of several days, she arrived at the office with a broken wrist. Her arm is in a cast and she has metal rods holding the broken bones in place.",0

"Hourly employees start arriving at 4am and then myself and the other managers will delegate the days plan to the employees. We are typically very understaffed to be able to work in new items, recover the floor and excute the GM’s planned item moves for the day, so after we delegate the managers become stockers and work alongside the hourly employees to get done. I don’t mind physical labor and hard work, it’s actually my favorite part of my job, but it’s hard to run an operation as large as restocking and remerchandising a 200,000 sq ft facility while you are stuck stocking. The store opens at 9:30 am at which point I will try to start my administrative tasks, but just like in the morning the building is usually understaffed so it’s more common than not for me to be either cashiering for several hours, or helping out in the deli and/or bakery. Some days I’m lucky enough to get a lot of time in the office to complete my daily tasks, but most days I do not.",1

You can still trigger them even though you are a good guy. You can still get offended when they tell you they can't trust you even though it is the PTSD talking and not them. You feel like a failure when they tell you they feel hopeless and that nobody can help them. It really sucks when all you want to do is love them and they can't accept it or feel it. Especially when they are the most amazing person you have ever met when they are not triggered and in their right mind.,0
"this has been happening for the longest time, and it's very hard to describe so bear with me. once in a while when i'm trying to sleep, suddenly my racing mind starts experiencing opposites at the same time. the most terrifying one is feeling like the world is expanding infinitely but also crushingly contracting in on itself. then there's also times when i focus so much on the silence in the environment that i end up feeling like the room sounds extremely loud. and a more physical one is feeling hot and cold at the same time, which prevents me from being comfortable enough to fall asleep.",1

The property was supposed to be sold on December 29th, but when my cousin who was also living on the property unexpectedly passed away on December 24th, the buyers backed out. Due to these circumstances, our home insurance had lapsed, so at the moment we have no resources to work with, except for the generosity of others.

"One of the couples I know is made up of cancer survivors:  the male had cancer as a child, thankfully beat it, but developed PTSD from the experience; the female has had 2 different battles with cancer (brain and breast), beat them both, but suffers from significant developmental issues (including cognitive delay and balance issues). They represent polar opposites on the spectrum of how cancer survivors can view the world:  one feeling positive about having survived so much, the other being angry with the world that it happened in the first place. That's neither here nor there. I'll stop for a moment to explain that I'm not one of those that feels PTSD isn't a real condition. I grew up in an abusive home for years, and it wasn't until my mid 20's that I began come to terms with how subtly that had affected me over the years.",0

This is in no way her fault, she has done nothing to deserve my questioning of my decision, this is my problem and mine alone.

Then I had an appointment with my psychiatrist and case worker at the clinic I go to. I shamefully told the doctor there that I had been out of control, off meds, binging on alcohol and not following advice.

He keeps saying im crazy not respecting his space where i keep asking for things to be amicable over and over. he tells me its my fault that everytime hes done anything to me its because i started it. I honestly dont know if its true. Because i kept trying to tell him leave me alone.,1
He pretty much told me that he was angry and disappointed and would probably not forgive me for a while and that I owe him. I was going to go... I still want to. I just am looking at either going to this wedding and being evicted or not going and dealing with the disappointment. I don't feel like I have a choice.,0
"We've funnelled about 4k into saving our dog's life. As you can see- we haven't gotten that in donations, but what we've gotten has really saved our asses. I found out my dog had a 'treatable' disease right after graduating from college. The college debt was already a burden, and after my partner got laid off- the panic set in that we would have to put my best friend down. He's too young for this, and has been too good to us.",1
I spent the next few years being extremely reckless and impulsive. My home life was never easy I had an odd relationship with most of my relatives except my mom who was probably the only reason why I am even stable to this day. My brother was always seen as the golden child and me as the problem child so I was constantly shamed by extended family for being so impulsive and reckless which we all know is common signs of PTSD in adolescents. I think my mom was ashamed of my initial assault and though I was able to get help I was never allowed to tell anyone about it and a lot of my extended family I didn't even tell until the last couple of years so this has left a strange dynamic for me of not knowing how I feel about telling people my story but also desperately wanting to share it. In 2011 I finally met my husband who is the only reason I'm even doing as successful as I am today.,1
"Unfortunately, it also affects pretty much everything in my life, including working memory and everyday events. It didn't happen daily or even weekly, but I was always afraid that I might say or do something that can trigger it, so I always kept quiet and didn't say much, and I guess that's why my language did not develop properly either. The neuropsychologist I saw offered me books to read to learn more about my condition but did not give any other treatment options because the cause of my disorder was unknown. I was wondering if maybe now that I know why I most likely struggle with memory, I can go back to get more solid treatment options? If so, who should I see for help?",1
"We've been getting along very well, and our previous repeated complaints on both sides of ceased because of this. But as time has gone on my feelings have changed in regards to me thinking I can accept this and work through it with her. I know I love her, and I don't really know how to explain my emotions here, but I no longer feel like ""her husband"", and I don't feel like she's ""my wife"", it's more like we're partners or room mates or something. I feel a vital part of our marriage (loyalty, and trust) is gone and it can't come back. In the end, I can't shake the thoughts of leaving and restarting my life.",1
"If its the wrong place for this feel free too delete,  it would be on par with the rest of the day. Edit:  thank you,  too those who've responded and any others who might. I always expect to get turned away whenever i ask for help,  especially when i read how others are suffering. It always makes my problems seem not worth anyone's time. So thank you,  it means a lot to me.",0
"Thanks. Edit 1 - Fuel Receipt As Requested. <url> Sorry for the long responses, I went to spend the night at a friends because it got really cold here! The Police said they don't give out a copy of the report but they gave me an incident number that can be used to verify the report was filed.",0
"Throwaway, changed names, etc... My ex and i dated for about 2 years and had an incredible relationship. Traveling, great sex, got along with each others family’s, you get the point. This was also my first serious relationship. “Steph” was the kind of girl who didnt click too well with other girls, so she gravitated towards guy friends more often.",0
"As is usually the case with the stories I read here, I've hit the bottom. I'm at the very last point before pitching a tent in a field, and begging at the street corner for pennies.

I feel like im receiving mixed signals from her as we usually talk for most of the day either thru texting or at work. (she chooses to sit by me everyday)   ---   **tl;dr**: How do I take things slow and not become clingy after not dating for a really long time? I really enjoyed getting to know her but I feel like im falling way too fast for this girl and Im not sure she feels the same way I do.,1

The research is intended to supply the researcher with information about strategies that could improve life satisfaction in individuals diagnosed with an SPMI. Completion time for the survey is approximately 15-25 minutes. Participants are only allowed to participate once in the current study.,0
"I have to talk to him and make nice, and pretend its ok, but I feel unsettled and on edge around him. I guess I don't know what to do, it's a complicated situation, and I feel that I'll never get the ""real talk"" I'd like to have with him, or any sort of apology. He seems rather narcissistic, not as bad as my own father, but enough to not want to admit his wrong doing and own up to it. Is this something I can get over on my own while still around him? Am I over exaggerating?",1

"She'll order so much food, and binges on it, while downing shots the whole time. The way she orders food and drinks kinda makes me change my eating and drinking habits when I'm with her. It's like I'm binging too. She always excuses herself to the bathroom right after a meal and I know she's purging. The more recent time I hung out with her, I put my foot down a little more and told her i didn't want to pay for so much food, and that I wasn't doing shots (I never do shots, but she always orders them for me when I'm out with her and then is really manipulative in order to pressure me to do them).",0

"But upon second look, it can become apparent. It is hard to convey people's attitudes in a reddit post, but you can tell from people's vibes if they're being nice (and yes, that happened a lot) vs. if they have ulterior motives.

Besides the larger point is that the prejudice is rampant, whether or not you like my example. That's the larger point.",0

I told him I would do everything I could to get there, I am honestly not sure if I want to go to prove I can, just because I care for my brother or because I am not being smart and compassionate enough to say no to myself.

"And godforbid I see an insect anywhere near me, even if it’s through a car window, jar, or whatever… oh boy, I get VERY anxious. Sometimes I have never ending anxiety that lasts for multiple days, and flares up at the worst times. And if I drink caffeine, oh man, that makes it even WORSE.

I’m wondering what I can do.",1
As of Sunday i have experience sever anxiety. Its too the point i am unable to do normal everyday functions and doing my job is harder. All i can think about is how i was ripped away from my daughter and how she is without me. Its to the point my therapist uas suggested i used cbd oil to manage my anxiety instead of narcotics. They help take the edge off and let me relax to the point i can sleep.,1
I made a decision that I had enough of this fear and I was going to die fighting and not be afraid anymore. I reached this point a few years ago. It is a wonderful thing to sleep peacefully. I was tired of wanting to sleep in my trunk in my car (in my garage) because I was afraid of sleeping alone in houses. I was tired of sleeping on the sofa or on the floor of different rooms just to avoid sleeping in bedrooms because of fear.,0

"I was home for winter break, and I didn't see him at all during that time.

"I come from an Asian family where kids are not expected to move out, its the opposite where kids are supposed to live at home and take care of the parents when they become adults, however living in America has made me hate this mindset because I am never able to be an individual. My dad is extremely controlling and a downright bully, he verbally abuses me and my siblings about anything possible just for the sake of abusing us. He always demands we listen to him and do things his way and if we don't we are ""disobedient"" and ""bad children"". He even abuses my mom verbally and she knows it but deals with because its how she was raised, even random strangers like waiters and cashiers at stores are bullied, he'll complain about lines being long and blame cashiers for being ""slow"" ect.

"I wanted to chalk it up to finances, but our finances weren’t nearly as bad as they had been, so I started thinking that maybe something else was going on. When I finally got the job that I’ve been working towards my entire life, and you got your settlement and the opportunity to do the things you had been talking about doing for your entire life, I began experiencing this odd feeling called “confidence.” Not just having confidence, but being confident.

I’ve already endured years of his psychological abuse and him physically raping me in the ass while we were together. I’ve already endured seeing him and the fact that he brings another man that raped me (and he knows it) to every hearing so far. I’ve endured him harassing our old mutual workplace and every individual mutual contact we had when it first fell apart. I’ve had him flip friends on me and had to move twice in the past to years to hide my location from him.,1

"I have a very hard time with trying to find a job, from most places I don't get any feedbacks, but get immediate rejection when I try to apply to other open positions at the same company. Interestingly there's a lot of propaganda around how there's a shortage on manpower, while at the same time people having difficulty finding jobs. There are notable instances of similar experiences, political opponents' family members getting fired for no reason, etc. My father did a big disservice to the local Fidesz by being a key figure against the prison project (which was going to be built by a company very well known for overpriced projects), my grandfather is a well known tankie (who's so racist he's often accidentally agrees with both Fidesz and Jobbik), not to mention I had a lot of bullies in secondary school who thought I was severely mentally disabled (long story short: I had some speech issues I've since overcome for the most part, but thanks to the Hungarian R-word I got some serious shit, such as being accused with my mother taking up huge benefit money which she spends on shoes and jewelry, which leads them having to pay a lot of taxes on their motorcycles, game consoles, phones, etc) and probably wanted to take their revenge this way (which is ironic, because the hard time I had financially radicalized me from an actual centrist to a radical leftist).

"Has anyone else who's dealt with anxiety their entire lives become very controlling in their relationships as a way to cope?

I sometimes augment my income with Mturk, but additional advice on how to make a little extra cash would be appreciated (would have to be one time gigs though due to the nature of my disability, I can't hold down a long term job.

"Its like that, if you want or not.“ ME: I have no problem, if it takes longer. But you asked my friend for help and let him wait for one hour and then you haven’t prepared anything. Thats not what you asked for. Instead of 3 hours, he helped you for 10 hours till 5am...",0
I wish I could go back and just not fuck up so horribly. I was begged not to go out on this date from tinder. My friend was raped off tinder and told me all guys want are sex off tinder. I had talked to my assaulter and told him I didn't want to be touched and he was fine with it and seemed perfectly normal. I'm so stupid.,1
"So I drank wine and I started crying and since my husband was constantly telling me that I ruined his life and he regrets being married to me and I'm the devil and blah blah, for the first time in my life I picked up the knife and I thought I should just kill my self. When my husband saw me he started screaming and snatched the knife away from me and said I am trying to get him into trouble by committing suicide. He kicked me and spat on me. I kept on try to explain to him that I can't take him blaming me for everything and he believes everything he says so hard that every works out of my mouth is a lie. I tried telling him I am trying to fix myself.",1
"Some examples: spit on me randomly in the eye doctor's office, giggled and strolled off when I looked up at him in horror. We had some verbal exchange in the hallway and he slapped me so hard I couldn't feel the tear roll down my cheek my face was so numb, he pinned me to the floor one day and savagely beat me for at least 7 minutes straight for what reason i forget, after he was done beating me up he would punch in the back of the head repeatedly, this gave me headaches and i saw flashes with each blow. And he would often have a gleeful look on his face after he was done. For the longest I didn't know this was abuse, nor did I know I had developed all of these poor coping mechanisms to deal with being abused. He ruined my life without me even being aware.",1
"But it hit close to home when my own parents have pressured me over the years to reconcile with my brother, angrily demanding how I'd handle their funerals, whether I'd insist on not going (I wouldn't. My brother was best man for our other brother's wedding, which I attended but declined being a bridesmaid, and kept a careful distance. Then I went home, drank an entire bottle of wine and cried while my husband comforted me). 2. I never would have known about my cousin's son if I hadn't been able to make the funeral yesterday.",1
"I can't take much more. I hate being unworthy of the truth and feeling like I'm crazy for thinking this. This feels like my entire life, with everyone I've ever expected to love and care for me. I'm fucking over it. TL;DR I know my boyfriend is probably on drugs, or at least was actively using for some period of time recently, and you will probably agree with me if you read the evidence.",1
"The curfew at the shelter keeps me grounded and safe from myself. The rules and the structure with morning routine even though I've just felt it for one day, has already boosted me. I used to stay up until 2-3am, blowing all my money just binging and purging. Now I have to pause and ride out my emotions. I have to be in bed at 10pm.",0
"Hey guys, I was watching Seth Meyers and he made a joke about the longest pizza event. I did some research and it will be on June 10th at the Fontana speedway in California. There will be over a mile of pizza and it needs to be eaten to count towards the record. This is a free event. I was thinking that this is somewhat related to the random acts of pizza lifestyle.",0
"I'm trying to keep my mouth shut, but shit is so goddamn annoying. Oh, and my both of their first languages are not English. While I speak only English. I criticize my father by telling him he speaks like Donald Trump. I'm gonna donate plasma tomorrow, because I'm broke.",1
"I recognise that he was not very nice but I can't get him out of my mind, I crave his attention and just wish he would want me. I know this is not healthy and good for me, but it is how I feel. I feel like I need him to tell me why he stopped loving me and what's wrong with me so I can change, but ultimately he's just not interested and I shouldn't really respect the opinion of an arsehole anyway! So I'm feeling very lost and still isolated. As I said, I seem to gravitate towards people who are not good for me and I have ended friendships recently which were obviously toxic for me.",1

"My sister is a shift worker - works around the clock at ridiculous times. I asked her (before I moved in) if she could sometimes pick me up from work if I worked late and if she could help me with my driving - she said yes. I've now asked a her a few times if we could drive somewhere she has said: ""no"", ""just because"", and ""I'm sick and tired"". She's lazy and selfish. I've asked her once if she could pick me up from work (as my dad was unavailable) knowing for a fact she's not working and I get a response saying ""I'll pick you up at the bus stop down the road"" - which doesn't help me at all.",1
"I was physically and sexually abused by my mom as a kid. She would pull my pants down and fondle my genitals from the time I was a child up until I moved out for college. This is something where I know it happened, and I can remember time after time how it had happened. About a month ago, though, I had a really vivid and visceral nightmare about a form of sexual abuse that I can't place in a timeline like I can with the other types of abuse. In this nightmare, my mom and I are naked in bed and she is touching me, until I get so scared that I push her away and fall out of the bed.",1

"I have no clue. I meditate twice daily, jog every morning, eat very healthy, absolutely love my life and am following my passion. Yet I’m struck with random physical anxiety all the time. No negative thoughts or anything like that, it’s purely physical. A very uncomfortable feeling in my chest.",1
"He apologizes if I point it out later, but the first instinct is always to blame me. And often the thing he's blaming me for is exaggerated, and made to look like a routine flaw in me, even if it's a once off thing. He doesn't hesitate to show his bad mood/displeasure (which applies to how he is around most people not just me, but I think it's worse when it's about me). He doesn't hide it at all even if we're around other people, so I have to be particularly cautious not to piss him off or bring up anything that could upset him in public. When he's upset/displeased in private, he withdraws and it's up to me to grovel and convince him to talk to me again.",1
"Has anyone else tried exercising regularly to help with anxiety? It’s been quite a while since I exercised regularly, haven’t really done it since my anxiety started.

Some very mild anxiety yesterday that passed within an hour or so, but that’s been about it.",0
"His consequences will never reflect or equate to the suffering I have endured and the life-long trauma that will impede on the rest of my life. Because on March 21st and 22nd in 2017, my humanity was shaken and distorted in ways that I still struggle to resolve. It exists in the shadows of nightmares I still have of his face, his screams, his weapons, his murder threats, suicide threats, and fists.

"I got as far as Illinois when he ghosted me after urging me to leave in the first place. I've been going between three different friends who know I'm homeless but think I'm 19. I want to go to school, get a job to buy my own stuff, and get on with my life. I don't think my mom is looking for me, but I still need her signature to go to school.

I don't need that. This sucks but is far from hopeless. I can do this with some help. The next bad thing came just two days out of the hospital. The lady who was letting me stay on her couch doesn't come home.,1
"I am so sleepy and want to sleep so bad but the second I lay down it gets worse. My chest and stomach actually tighten up with anxiety and *all* I can do is think about Pippa. Now, what I did was irresponsible and I *should* feel bad about it. But this level of anxiety about something that happened 6-7 years ago that I can't do anything about now is insane. I tried talking to my family about it, but they even disagree on the basic premise that Pippa was even neglected.",1
"I haven’t said anything to him yet because I’m not sure how someone would take hearing that their partner has such fluctuations of feelings towards them (especially since he told me he loves me and is somewhat clingy).

"	It was the summer, I had just started a new job as a bartender.  I met a girl that was equally odd, had a lot of similar interests, was looking for the same thing I was.  We quickly became enamored with each other. It didn't take long for us to move in together.  I started finding projects around the house to fix up, she would surprise me with home cooked meals or a note gushing over our relationship.",0
"She was seventeen and they met in a hospital, he was in the drug rehab, she was in the mental hospital. She was 17, and he technically kidnapped her, running across the country. She immediately got pregnant with me, and he married her, at which point the law washed their hands of the matter. I was born premature, 5 months and 3 weeks, which in 1981 was very dangerous. I spent 8 months in an incubator, and had heart surgery, but lived, and have not had health problems.",0
"And I know it wouldn't completely or even halfway make up for me being an asshole lately, but I want to have some improvement on her life with her being loyal to me despite me not even being able to be there for her as a boyfriend.

I am near Denver, Colorado. And I am hoping for this to be sent to my GF because she truly deserves something great.",0
"I started to get depressed but was personally unaware. My wife started to notice that I wasn't eating, was moody, not sleeping, and laying in bed all day. She asked me if I was ok and I... broke down. All emotions came to a tipping point and I started whaling in tears. I told her I had been thinking about suicide.",1
"So I knocked and told her to please let me in. She refused, I told her I was sorry and I didn’t mean any of the things I said and that I love her very much. She said to go away so I did (we were at her house). Now a whole day passed and she still refuses to talk to me :( I’m worried, guilty and just want to hug her and tell her again that I’m sorry. I sent her some messages but she ignored them.",1

I asked around and the last person I asked said he was headed that way and I could join him and his wife, provided I showed some ID, I look younger than I am, so he assumed I was a runaway. When I rode to Brunswick he preached to me about God and told me he was from Florida. Another storm approached.",0
"I constantly cancel plans on friends because sometimes going out is just too much. I recently heard about a friend of a friend who passed away at 25 from breast cancer and instead of empathy or sympathy, all I could feel was terrified fear that I would get diagnosed with the same cancer that she had. That was all I could think about - and that always happens when I hear about someone else dying. Ugh. I don't even know.",1
"So the now: we had been commiserating for a while about our shitty exes and stress, and about 3 weeks ago I was on a date and realized I would have rather just spent the night with her instead of the date. A couple days later while having some drinks and de-stressing I kissed her. She kissed me back. We stopped before having sex and ended up meeting a couple days later where we both agreed to take things slow, in light of our most recent breakups. We ended up spending the next few nights together as she didn't want to be home around her ex and we just cuddled and would kiss but then stop before we had sex.",0

I've never spoken to anyone about my anxiety but I'm pretty sure I have generalized anxiety disorder. When I was young I used to be very bright and would take charge of projects and doing assignments. As time went on I became lazier but still fairly on top of things.

I have an amazing group of friends filled with the most genuine people you'd ever meet. And I'm a college graduate. I have this deep fear that he'll be right. I'm terrified that I only think I've broken the cycle but I haven't really. Thanks to PTSD I'll probably still have those moments.,1
"It’s Open Enrollment, most government systems in the US are poorly managed so most go without full knowledge what they’re signing up for, and the pressure of management can be intense to reach certain “metrics.” I enjoy the money but the politics of it all be disconcerting. It’s not at all what I want to do with my life. I’ve been in and out of doctors appointments for my thyroid goiter. My mom said my great grandfather had the same thing and it causes anxiety. But most of it stems from my verbally abusive, alcoholic dad and being raped twice in my life.",1

"&nbsp; This piece of art I’ve used is a perfect example of how having solid boundaries can help me weather any storm. I know I’m going to get kicked, I know I’m going to be in pain but I also see the beauty in between the clouds. This is a painting I did freezing in the hail and storm on the rocks of Alloutte Lake.

"Are you fucking kidding me? YOU are not comfortable writing something to help me? YOU'RE uncomfortable writing a note and helping someone with a mental illness?

WHAT.",1
"Leaving was one of the hardest things I had ever had to do. My parents really disagreed with me taking time off from school, so as fall came, they spent every day trying to get me to go see if I could come back in the spring, and to get a job. Now job has always been a scary word for me, because my only job I've had is teaching people how to hit things beautifully (Percussion Private Lessons). I had come so close to interviews in the past, but I could never get myself to leave as the day came. This lead to my parents becoming more and more frustrated, and the only person I could seek refuge with, was Sarah.",0

"Regarding my abuser, I still feel my heart ache with compassion, and the understanding that no human being is born a monster; it is an environment poisoned with violence they grew up in that guides them into life as an abuser. I have prayed every single day for John Doe and his foster family, in the hopes that he can overcome his inner demons and lead a life of peace. But if and when he finds a new woman to victimize and rob her of dignity, worth, and benevolence, I feel proud that I have taken steps to ensure that even if she is too afraid to step forward, I have taken that first step in her honor. I feel proud to have set the precedent to lead him on a path for growth and healing if he chooses. I feel proud to have broken that silence.",0

It was all so wrong of me. It started happening when we went to my father's bday weekend and a family member groped me and I remembered that he also did stuff like that. A lot of em did. My partner was sad and fell asleep after I told them. I couldn't sleep.,1
"I forgot about it until I noticed one day that I saw a co workers name written on a receipt that was for a room sale (we stapled the receipt of the room sale on the back of the vip room tracking sheet to keep up with sales) I asked the manager what that was about. He told me that that is how the bookkeepers keep track of who sold which room so they will get credit and the surcharges of the sale. So I explained to him I was never told of this and explained that in my six month tenure I had never received anything. He then told me he would help me go through each sale with me to make sure I get the amount I was supposed to get. I was fired a week after that conversation because an entertainer tipped me 80 bucks when I made her 3500 I never complained or anything about it, but they fired me for not splitting that 80 bucks with everyone.",0
"I think it was last year, we could hear the little girl crying out so loud inside their home, we called the cops. This is just a rumor, but our next-door neighbors say that the house is actually under police watch, and that they're drug dealers.

There are always cars coming and going from the house, sometimes the same cars, other times cars we've never seen before. Ya know, to buy drugs and shit.",1
"I get a text from my brother that was essentially, ""fuck off and die, nobody wants you here anymore."" Clearly I need to move out, but the only person I have in my life is my boyfriend, and although we see each other often, we've been long-distance for awhile and it would be a huge adjustment to move almost 100 miles away (although it would be far enough away from them.) Although I love him a lot, I don't exactly want the reason that I move in because he's trying to save me. I want to move in because I want to start a new life with him, not to run away from the old if that makes sense. So, I guess my question is, what do I do?",1

"Well Reddit, I don't even know where to begin... I guess I will start at the start of my relationship with my now wife and mother of my beautiful little girl. Our relationship came on suddenly and the surprise that is my daughter came on extremely surprisingly to me. I was already 36 years old and had been in several long term serious relationships that for one reason or another ended prior to marriage and  I had long since just assumed I was incapable of fathering a child. I was years past all the stages of grief on the subject.",0
"Realistically, because of geographic lockdown, (needed) pay grade, etc, it's going to take a good year for me to switch. I need a way to maintain until I can get out.

"I just need to get this off my chest with people who will get it. I can't stand being in this situation where I feel like my reaction to something could be coming from the PTSD in which case it was an overreaction, or if the thing done to me was actually shitty and the reaction was warranted. Or some sort of combination of both. I can't see other options. I just have ended up feeling guilty for self-advocacy because I have this internalized feeling (only just now realizing I have this) from my past that he was right, I am just crazy and needy and the abuse was justified.",1

I'm starting Effexor XR, Prazosin for the horrendous nightmares and continuing on clonazepam for panic attacks. Thanks guys!",1
I have a question about my ex who has a past of violence against women. I was never warned about it but I found out he was violent and I left. His ex has a full life restraining order against him.Now he is on probation for assaulting a police officer for 3 years in the past year he has gone to jail three times for domestic violence. His latest trip to jail was last week for domestic violence his third time. I was wondering what do you think his punishment will be since he's not learning his lesson from the punishments given to him and he just doesn't care.,0

"No history of DV, married 8 years, together 10 years, nothing like this has ever happened before. We have two children, 2 & 5 that unfortunately witnessed nearly everything. Sunday night we had both been drinking, she was significantly more intoxicated than I (likely due to not eating much that day.) She came out of our bedroom and started ""doing"" the dishes - slamming everything in the process. I raised my voice telling her to go to bed and I would handle the dishes - she snapped, started screaming, hitting me in the chest (slapping to be a little more precise if alcohol+adrenaline actually allow for vivid memory recollection) before I know it she has a knife - I take it out of her hand and grab the second knife that was in sight (dinner had recently been prepared, we used multiple knives to do so) I threw them both in the trashcan, but her rampage continued and she soon had yet another knife in her hand, this time pointed directly (or close to) her heart, stating that she wanted it to all be over, never wanted any of this (we relocated 800 miles for my work approx 3 weeks ago and left behind every friend and family member we have that could help either of us right now) I grabbed both of her wrists and we struggled, we both hit the ground and I held her down until I could remove the knife from the situation - at some point I was stabbed just above my thumb even though I did not realize it until minutes later.",1
I’ve always been the type of person who’s been gravitated towards romance. The thought of loving someone and being loved in return was nice but I’m a closed off person who’s too afraid to let someone in. I recently got into a relationship with someone who is really incredible. He’s very patient and understanding about my anxiety and depression. It took a while and a few arguments for me to open up a little bit.,0
"As mentioned above, my girlfriends gets pissed off when I act uninterested in her friends and starts accusing me of hating them, which is ridiculous because I hardly even know them, and she gets really upset and stops talking to me for awhile. I'm starting to think that it's gonna end up being a choice between me or her friends and so far, I'm losing. TL;DR: My girlfriend's friends are annoying as fuck and I'm not very fond of them. I don't ever say anything negative about them, yet my girlfriend still gets pissed off if I don't praise them. All our arguments are about them.",1
"Hello So I've had chronic social anxiety since I can remember. I had a pretty traumatic childhood, which has resulted in me being socially awkward, and very nervous in social setting.

"I'll try to keep this short and succint so it's easier to read. I had a very brief relationship with this girl. We both conected inmediately and tried to be in a relationship. We both had problems that consumed us: she was bulimic and I had erections issues; we both had parent issues and a nihilistic aproach to life. I wasn't a (mentally) strong boy, I was very immature and naive, I suppose she was kind of the same.",0

"He wants me to study abroad in Europe after undergrad, then return and work for the government in economics. I don't mind the Europe part, but I have zero interest in working for the government and am absolutely shit at economics and I've told him so. No matter how many times I express my lack of interest, qualification, or skill at economics, he ignores me and continues to push this path. It wasn't like this was something he's pushed on me my whole life - it's like he came up with this plan for me when I  turned 18, and now is obsessed with it. I really don't know what to do.",1
"I’m very concerned that I might never be able to put a condom on, last in bed or satisfy a woman with my penis. The girl was very satisfied and even exhausted and she said that it was the most times she cums in one night and that the previous guys just stuck it in and thrusted ( which I’m secretly jealous honestly since I’m concerned that I might not be able to stick it in right now). she keeps texting me now about meeting up again. She said I’m great with my hands and I’m a great kisser but she kept silent about my penis which I was apparently very bed using it. I kept my cool throughout the night and laughed it off and she was very cool and said that she was expecting it but I’m very concerned that I might have a deformity or something.",1
"When sis ""woke up"" as a teenager, she started raising hell about the singing evangelist father who'd held her by the wrist, telling her to ""watch and learn"" while her older sister was forced to copulate him. (Bro was hiding behind the clothes & sliding doors in the closet, watching through the crack.) Spouse had been threatened repeatedly with extinction (from the age of three until she was well-normalized at 13) to ""perform."" (Grampa got *his* turns, too.) Moreover, the perp beat and otherwise terrorized the mother into submission, and then manipulated her to get out of his way when my two step-daughters were left there by my dissociated spouse.",0

"The simplest breathing technique can help you calm your mind. It's called diaphragmatic breathing. Simply, place your hands on your belly, then ribs, then upper chest and practice breathing into your hands. At the end, you place one hand on your belly and the other on your heart and breath into your belly up to your heart and back out again. By placing my hands on your body, you can choose a certain number of breaths to count and focus on the physical sensation of your hands rising and falling.",0
"I didn't tell anyone, not even my family. I felt I had to protect them; They were already insolved with CPS (Trust me, though, they're awesome) and I knew if i brought abuse into our case, I would inevitably send them down an unnecessary path. Social workers don't blame the abuser, they jump to the conclusion of negligent parents; Parents who were irresponsible enough to not know this was going on. They didn't know, they didnt know because they couldn't know. I went out for a few hours and they assumed I was hanging out with my friends, at least that's what I planned to do; They assumed I went to school and got an education, not beatings when the teacher was out of the room.",1
"That was easy, I was probably anxious about my health because I lost a very close relative when I was 11. The second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place. Checking my records of doctor visits, I could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. The stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. Another trigger would be something I heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness.",1
"Having expected that, I told myself at the time that it doesn't bother me much and I'll go back to handling it all by myself as I've been doing for years, but it's been nagging at me for most of the day now. I keep doubting whether I really am wallowing in it. My trauma occured five years ago, and it doesn't bother me anywhere near as much as it used to (thanks to some tricks I learned on here and through my own research), and I believe I've been handling it all okay. I do my level best not to dwell on it, I've accepted it's in the past and will never happen again...except that doesn't stop the flashbacks and nightmares. I wasn't directly involved in my traumatic events, I only saw and heard them.",1

"I'd like to note that I have had a couple close individuals look at my emails, evidence, etc since the last court date.

He said I’ve ordered an uber for us, which I thought I was being dropped back at home; I don’t actually remember the ride home in the Uber.

I'm so used to being forced to submit to him that I no longer have a voice. He heavily favors my sister over me and would buy her anything she wanted in a heartbeat.

I was gently talked away from the edge by campus security and they took me to see my counsellor. I havent seen her since this happened and Im due back at uni next week.",1
I will stay with the sub to offer any advice I can but thought a success story was worthy to share. They say never destroy a person's hope. It may be all they have left. Much love to you all for the good tips and advice during my struggle. Thanks!,0
"I don't think I've ever felt soo intimidated by someone before. I feel like I'm going to melt whenever I'm around him. Although you're thinking, what's the worst that can happen. He rejects you? Previously, I made a stupid attempt to try and hook up with him during one of my ""breaks"" with my boyfriend (we previously broken up for a few months, but got back together during the 3 years together).",0
He would call me by the name peepee until I was 21. I asked him to stop but he just yells at me. I wish he would die or never talk to me. He also forces me to take medication because I got mad at him because of this. He will just scream at me and threaten to call the police to throw me on the street or something.,1
"When I was 17, my mom turned her attacks on my writing into high gear. She constantly berated me about how pointless, worthless, stupid and childish it was to write. How I'd never make it as a writer. How I'd be poor and alone. How (again) I needed to stop doing ""childish things"" like writing (and any other hobby/passion she decided to attack that day) and grow up.",0
"He wasn't ambitious or motivated anymore, he was sad, depressed, always pessimistic and never really doing any work. I ended up not only doing all development work, but also our social, PR and leg work as well here in NYC making relationships. This lead him to feel more left out I am assuming. Many times he has decided to hinder the business due to reasons related to what I mentioned. For instance, one time we were creating an ad for a campaign we were running for the app.",0
"At the moment my prediction is to spend the year attending classes, applying for scholarships, and working during the day before couch hopping with a few friends for a month or 2 and spending the rest of the time staying in hostels when I can or sleeping on the streets when I can't before hopefully getting into college where I'll have a reliable bed. TL;DR: Working on boosting my resume, making friends that I can couch hop with for some time, and getting a paying job. Thanks for your time! Edit: Holy shit, thanks for the gold! I have no clue why you'd go and do somethin like that, but I appreciate it nonetheless!",0
"If so, what methods have been most helpful? What changes in your relationship with your body have you noticed that have made the biggest difference? Has this method of therapy made it easier to keep triggers at bay or at least more manageable? Have there been any negative experiences with somatic therapy and if so what has been the most challenging part of it? Thank you for taking the time to read this post, I look forward to reading your responses.",0
"Another update: I received two messages from random women yesterday. It turns out my boyfriend/abuser has been cheating on me, which is not surprising at this point. One of them, he went to get us food while I was home with my son, he paid for this woman's family's meal and got her number, and has been asking her out for drinks every couple days. She sent me screen shots of their conversations and he said, ""The ring I gave her is simply a gift to the woman carrying my child. We have had a rocky relationship and I can not see us as anything more than co-parenting"", then said, ""I don't work well with crazy"".",1
She referred me to a dermatologist who was known to treat white gay guys and other asian gay guys with genital warts. That's how gossipy these doctors can be. I went to this new dermatologist and showed her my growths. She then showed me pictures of genital warts from her textbook. They looked like cauliflowers.,0
"I don't mind the fact that she goes, I don't even mind if she goes at the same time as me. I just wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of doing it together. How do I convey this to her without looking like a selfish asshole? **Tl;dr: I prefer to work out by myself for various reasons. My roommate decided to start going with me and is requesting that I make accommodations to my schedule and routine so that she can join me.",1
"Now he is enraged because I said months ago that maybe internet access was not a bad idea, that there was some stuff there that may connect him more to others. He had been asking for months how to access the internet for free, and I just did not know what to say, he mentioned it so much, besides he would have to get internet access from a company if he wanted to use the internet reliably. So he did that at some point, and is now having issues. It just looks like an older man who is having difficulty navigating the internet and who finds Apple care unhelpful. But he is phoning me today yelling and accusing me of paranoid stuff and hanging up.",0
"We’ve been together for two and half years but went through a rough patch not too long ago because I shipped off to basic. But now that I’m back we were good but now her depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies are pushing me away. I’m trying my best to support her but it’s so hard because I’m just her boyfriend? Not her shrink or doctor. Idk what to do anymore because I try my best to help her but she doesn’t really care anymore.",1
"Oh fucking boy! My ex boyfriend made me think he was Prince Charming, but then it turned out he was just an asshole who wanted to date my ex bully/stalker. She is JUST like me because she was obsessed with me for one and a half years. She is a prettier me, so instead of leaving me like a normal person, he abused me and used his incredibly strong narcissism to make every problem I had about him. He tried to make me dump him so his plan would all correlate.",1
"I work with her sister. Her sister got me this great job at our firm after I was introduced through a mutual friend and hit it off. I'm not unqualified, but her recommendation certainly helped. I met my ex through her sister. Her sister is charming, personable, but also the most vindictive person I've ever seen.",0
"* Her, a week ago: Precious, how are you? (I ignored her.) * Her, Jan 1: Happy year precious, happy year love for more years at your side we haven't lived much together but we will stay all our lives to live and it that stays to live. **You are one of the best people I have met in my life. ** You are one of the best people I have met in my life (she says this twice) that you have always been here for everything and you always will be.",0
"It's just us two and it's, really intense. She hugs me, tells me how much she's missed me. Reminisces about our relationship. Tells me how I broke her heart. She tells me about lads she's been with since and it felt like she was comparing them all to me and gets really emotional.",1
"Title gives the gist of it, the link has a bit more info (apologize for grammar errors, my Aunt started the fundraiser and she is not the best at grammar) please help and/or share.

16 years ago when I was 6 9/11 happened. That's the day everything changed for me. My mom was a first responder she was a social worker in the city and volunteered with the Red Cross the next day. She spent 4 months at ground zero. Some of my earliest memories are of the towers falling.,0
"Oh Jesus Christ. I blacked out in front of my family- my family with a history of alcoholism (I'm an alcoholic too), my family that I promised I wouldn't get drunk in front of....I don't know what I said but they are PISSED. I come from a sort of passive aggressive family and they won't tell me what I said. I am so terrified and filled with shame and completely embarrassed. I know a lot of my family members' secrets that I'm not supposed to know and I easily could have spouted them out.",1
"He saved me from my family. I don't want to give up on him because he's never given up on me. TL;DR: Boyfriend often has tantrums where he throws objects around the room, but never physically hits me. Is this abuse? How do I get help?",1
I drove the 10 minutes home with my fiance on the phone helping me count my breathing. I got home and collapsed. I couldn't breathe. My neck and chest hurt. I was hysterical.,1
"Really hoping someone might have some insight for me! A couple years ago I (31,F) befriended one of colleagues (28,M). We were working for a small company that was also hemorrhaging cash, and eventually it was just him, me and some older coworkers in this open space office. Anyway, we really got along! We would have lunches, text in the evenings and weekends, and often go to the pub after work.",0
"So I've had PTSD a few years now, coming up on a decade as of December 2018, and in the last year or so I've undergone a lot of change, for the best. I figured since I've found these things to be very important in my fight against this, that I'd share them here. First thing first is to mention therapy. You've got to do it, and it's going to fucking hurt. Medication is also important if you need it.",0
"Sorry for the essay, poor grammar and punctuation. Thursday night. I asked a friend what they were up to tonight by text and instantly got a phone call after. Now usually I’d  ignore their called calls due to the worry of having an awkward phone conversation. This time I answer and we agree for them to come over.",0
"I also always bite and pick at my lips, meaning I usually have a patch of dried blood. I also chew my nails (though I've found if I clip my nails almost everyday it goes away). I know these behaviors are typical of OCD but I don't have other OCD symptoms so I think it's just my anxiety. Any tips would be appreciated. Or if you just want to share your habits go ahead.",1
If you knew Garret you would never have seen this coming. The family is exhausted at this point. I just want to do anything I can to help them and this is the platform I have. Any little thing helps. I can't think of a more caring family that is totally deserving of any help they can get.,0
$400 would suffice but $500 will drastically help boost my income for 4/4. Time frame for repayment listed includes $100 tip and is at-worst scenario. In other words loan may be repaid sooner. Thank you for your consideration. Sean,0
"Hello, As is probably always the case, I have no idea how to start this post. My girlfriend of the past year asked me to sit and talk to her yesterday where she opened up and told me how the relationship had run its course and how there was no chance it could be saved. I have known something wasn't quite right for a while and should have made efforts to make changes long before now. We are still going to remain friends as best we can until the tenancy on our flat runs out.",1
I'll have written a letter to give to her. The letter is to repeat what I wanted to say for later so that she can read in case she has any misunderstandings or if I don't communicate it well. I don't know how to word my reasons to break up though. Obviously I don't want to say the reason is because of her physical appearance. Should I say I only see her as a friend but nothing greater than that?,0
"I'm a 20 year old guy and go to school with 3 friends, a 20 year old guy, a 20 year old girl and 19 year old girl. All 4 of us have been friends for a few years. All of us are interested in art/drawing and took an art class together last semester at the college we attend. While we were all chatting over break, one of the girls made a comment that it would be nice if we could get more practice with drawing the nude figure since she is taking a class on it this coming semester. I commented that if she wanted, the 4 of us could form a practice group, with each of us taking turns acting as a model.",0
"During the walk she made a lot of threats about how she was going to call the police, put me in jail, even try to get me deported (I'm a LPR.) She gets vindictive like this but usually calms down. Due to the threats I called the police to ask their advice. The officer wanted me to give him her information and I declined. Short story, he gave me two options.",1
"Above all else he made me feel not that I owed him for such affections. He made me feel worth something, that I was important and beautiful. He gave me back my soul and so very much more until I married him. I know this story might not be what you want to read – I didn’t fight the good fight by myself. Nor did I find my self-worth by myself – well I did in a way, but my friend, my love and eventually my husband held my hand with every shaky step I took.",0
"I check my phone even though I know she won't reply. How do I get past this? Where did I go wrong?   ---   **tl;dr**: sent my friend a love letter, basically, and she never responded and then proceeded to block me on everything.",1
"I won’t have to make that decision to either shut up and let him have his way or or risk my safety and the safety of my family. I’m not bound to him anymore, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t panic at the end of each day in the split second that I think it’s going to happen again. I’m an adult now, not a child that was groomed and broken like a horse. I’ll never again have to ask “Can we stop now please?” and get a no. I’ll never have to ask if I’m allowed to put on my clothes and leave.",0
"Whenever I have a reaction or meltdown, he always tries to give shitty advice like ""just think about the things you're grateful for."" I'm sorry, but in the therapies I've taken and in the books I have to help me, nothing *anywhere* says anything about gratitude and it tends to trigger me when he says this because it's what my narcy mom would say to me. I tried to explain this and asked him to read my books and he got mad at me because in his mind I was trying to tell him what to do and I was being ""ungrateful"" for his help. I told him how important it was to me for him to read these books because it would help me feel more understood, but he keeps coming up with excuse after excuse about why he doesn't want to read them. I just don't know what to do anymore.",1

"I endured months and months of all types of abuse, the final time was when he grabbed an iron gym equipment that you attach to the wall and threatened to hit my pregant stomach with it. After all of this, after denying my child, saying he wasnt the father, after taking everything he had from me, i missed an important detail: A witness stood quiet. To this day, I think heavily of this, and I fear that karma will get them both (heavens forbid) through the child. Please.",1
"I get where she's coming from, but only if there had been inappropriate conversation or actions on my or my ex wife's part. My ex wife and I have literally zero feelings for each other, other than friendship and concern for one another as we are our son's parents. I don't know really what to do at this point. Maybe someone can give me some insight? ---",1
Some day it’s gonna piss them off and she’ll get killed. She lets people go ahead of her in line if she has more items than them. She lets people out of junctions even if she’s running late to places. Ends up holding doors open for tons of people and can get stuck there for almost a minute. Gave up her seat on a bus once when she knows I have a bad back and like to sit down.,0
"The first is my girlfriend of around 9 months. She doesn't really like her current living situation and suggested we look together. The positives here are that we get along pretty well as far as my relationships have gone, and it would save me money, probably around $5-600 a month. That's not insignificant. The thing is I probably *could* be ready for that step if I had to, I'm just not really for or against it.",0
"I am still rather lacking in social skills. Writing this is gradually helping me calm down. Does anybody else feel this way too? Several years ago I just gave up on life, not in the way suicidal people do, but, I just stopped putting in any effort to achieve any goals or plans since it wasn’t working, I stopped standing up for myself or resisting other people, I stopped doing anything that was hard or required effort or that caused me emotional pain, that triggered panic attacks. Not because I wanted to die but because I wanted to live, to live a life free of those burdens.",1
"They actually skyped on New Years (mostly for the sake of his Grandmother (his father’s mother) who he has a positive relationship with but somehow they are friends??) Anyways--- **MY MOTHER:** My mother, is a self-proclaimed ""Jewish mother"". She subscribes to all the stereotypes and upholds them, and is disgustingly proud of it.",0
"Hey everyone, throwaway for personal reasons. Tonight my girlfriend met her lady friend she didn't see for a year. I bought them wine, paid for dinner and was happy to give them the entire night if they wanted to so they could spend time together. Later on in the night I received a call at 1am requesting me to take her home. I get there and there's a person I've literally never seen before, a guy.",0
"I am so confused! Why is he playing these games? I have made it clear I want him back and to me it’s like he has feelings but is unwilling to say anything? TL;DR I’ve been dating a guy for a few months, we split up over a silly petty argument, since we’ve split up he’s been maintaining that he wanted us to break up but he’s checking in on me and asking what I’m doing. Is he just being controlling or does he have feelings still?",1
"I have tried every basic medicine like Prozac, Zoloft, etc. right now I take 15 of Buspar twice a day, Effexor 150 once, and 30 of Vyanse twice a day. I can’t get out of bed or do anything without Vyvanse even though it lasts maybe 5 hours. Ican sorta tell a difference from the Effexor, like I don’t feel as emotional. But I still experience severe anxiety almost every day and it does nothing to help my panic attacks.",1
"Two days ago I packed all of my clothes into my car and have started living out of it. I sleep in the parking lot at work, work for 8 hours, and then spend the day at Starbucks on the internet and charging my electronics. Once Thursday rolls around I will have ~$400, which is not much as far as being able to afford a place to sleep. If I become good at living out of my car over the next few days, I may just use some of that money to invest in making it easier for myself. I don't really know why I'm posting this here, except that living out of your car is a pretty lonely experience.",1
"I have been always told that I was a burden, a waste of space and that I was a fuck up even tho I'm the only one in my family 2 get any qualifications nevermind getting into uni. I'll most likely end up homeless as I can't even work as I have little work experience and I try part time jobs just 2 end up having a panic attack early on which got me fired each time. My friends are all at uni doing well 2 which makes me feel worse while I'm at home being a sack of shit who stays indoors all day with no social interaction other than my parents berating me about life. I don't even know what 2 do and it's killing me. My friends constantly remark about me being a mess.",1
"I'm afraid of going into too much detail only because I constantly fear that he knows that I talk about him. To keep it short, my father was physically violent towards me, my mother, our dog, mistreated all of his animals, leaked our information on shady sites before multiple times, and has made my life a living hell up until I went to court to stop having visitation with him. I almost died twice thanks to him. I thought that it wouldn't really affect anything outside of startle reflex, trust issues, etc, but here I am years after my last visit with him and it's still affecting me fucking terribly. I just sat in bed sobbing for a half hour because I'm afraid of everyone around me.",1
"I know the best thing for me is to find a new job, but I've been applying for quite awhile now with no luck and I really don't want to move to another job that I don't enjoy and will make me feel the exact same way. I sort of think I have an idea of what I want to do, but I have no idea how to make it happen while still paying my bills so I've been applying to anything that seems like it might be relevant to me, but I'm not sure the right way to go about getting into a field I don't have a degree in. Because of this I feel trapped in my job right now and it gets so bad some days where I feel like just walking out and quitting or just not going in ever again. I'm rambling at this point, does anyone else deal with a job that makes them completely miserable? How do you deal with it?",1
"My father is an alcoholic, and he has been for about 34 years. My mom has had to deal with this the entire time, and lately, he has been having parties at their house and drinking up until 3-4am almost every weekend. He drinks everyday, and my mother usually comes to me to vent about it. I’ve honestly lost my patience because I feel she should do something about it, but she won’t. She’s afraid to leave because he says he’ll accuse her of abandoning the home.",1
"It did still worry me a little though. Then last night, I rushed to a doctor because I was getting severe chest pains and my heart was beating so fast. And today I've just been getting so many of my old symptoms back. Trouble breathing, choking sensations, weird body aches...you name it. I can't help but feel I've somehow taken two steps backward after doing so well.",1
"The judge had to postpone the court date. As of this morning janes mother appeared at the house and gave jane the NEW lease showing that jane is no longer on the lease and wants her out. She left almost immediately, to avoid the police that were called right away. And now she does not know what to do .... I wish I can help but I dont know either.",0
Not sure the best way to describe it but for the last week and a half I have had to be social and around people every day except for a couple of hours each evening and it is KILLING ME. I’m on edge constantly because I need a break to just start over. And now I’m on the way to a 3 day work seminar in another country and I feel like there is zero mental energy left. I get back and then have work on Monday again. Anyone else feel like they need a day or two alone to “recharge” their (mental) energy?,1
"My boyfriend is really understanding about everything, but he wants me to eventually come clean to my mother because he thinks that it's unhealthy for me to have to keep this from my mom. PLus he knows how bad I'm freaking out about it. My brother and my dad know but they can't tell my mom and they aren't much help in this situation, since my mother runs the house. For Christmas, my boyfriend bought me a hat, several CDs, and concert tickets. Irrelevant right?",1
"Here's the link to my amazon wish list where the two items are: <url> If the link doesn't work, let me know.

"Okay this is driving totally insane and I can't function normally because of it, I have had intrusive thoughts basically for as long as I can remember, though now they are pushing me closer and closer to insanity. I am only focusing on one disturbing thought now which I really only need serious and helpful answers for. To start off, I remember it being the start off 2015 and I was sleeping over at my best friends house who we will call ""J"". Now J and I would always stay up all night when having sleepovers, and this certain night I managed to pull through to 6:30 am 30 minutes after J had fallen asleep, though when I woke up I was in his sisters bed. Now since then up until now, I just assumed that I was literally half asleep and that I was just looking for anywhere comfortable to sleep that wasn't taken in my literally half asleep state of mind (both his sisters had stayed up all night in the living room I've believed up until this moment, also something to keep in mind is that both of us were to young to be consuming alcohol and I have no memory of myself entering their room.",1
"The only truly good therapist I've been to was in Sweden, she listened, took extensive notes, remembered stuff and didn't talk about herself or her personal life. I need to see a therapist but I don't know what to do. I can't teach my therapists how to do their job nor should I feel like I need to in the first place. I also have chronic illnesses which makes it tiring (if not at times impossible) to have to constantly fight back against all my doctors to make sure they actually treat me and my symptoms and not just the numbers on my chart. It's gotten to the point where I'm really pessimistic about getting better or even being able to get good help.",1
"November has been one of the worst months in a long time. My mom was in a car accident and has no idea how she's getting to work. A few days later my grandmother died and I didn't even have enough money to attend the funeral. I drove home to be with my family, and to drive my mom 5 hours to the airport. I spent a ton on gas and now money is tight.",1
"The past few nights I have been drifting off to sleep and then I get the sensation that I'm falling and jerk awake. This happens for hours. I forget the scientific name for this, but it doesn't really matter. I've had it happen before to me, but never like 50 times in a row that prevents me from sleeping. Like fucking why?",1
"I don’t know why I’m writing this. I don’t know what people will say, I’m seeking therapy for this, I’m openly involving my SO in this so that I don’t feel too isolated, and so she doesn’t either. It felt surreal to tell her and it feels surreal to type it out. If anyone can hear me, please reach out. Thank you.",1
"Need to make a move now or never Update: I texted her more about it and she forgot about what happened until I reminded her! She said It’s not off the table, she just felt braver yesterday due to the liquid courage.

"After burning out, I fumbled through a tough, 8-year commitment in the United States Marine Corps. I then went back to college and  obtained an Associates Degree with a 4.0 GPA, before burning out just shy of a Bachelors. Following that, by leveraging my limited IT experience from the Marine Corps,  I landed a job averaging $110k annually with a Fortune 500 company.

So my roommate recently moved out and our apartment is pretty empty and ever since she moved out i’ve had the worst anxiety attacks and have been kinda depending on my boyfriend and spending time with him to distract me but he works night and that’s when my anxiety is the absolute WORST. everything flutters through my head. like i think i’m annoying him by asking him to spend so much time with me?? (he’s never expressed this. he’s actually expressed the complete opposite which is nice) but i feel like i’m being too clingy and too annoying leading me to want to spend some alone time in my apartment but my apartment just makes me more sad because i’m alone and i feel useless like no one care???,1

Yet I’ve already been through the worst and come out smarter and stronger. I’m not so afraid that I’m just running and not fighting it anymore. So WHAT exactly am I afraid of?

"You’re swimming smoothly with the current, the temperature isn’t too cold, and the water is calm and clear blue. So why can you only ever see it as being murky? Sometimes, you find yourself swimming higher and higher, until your fingers skim the interface between the water and the air above. You can see the rays of sunlight above piercing through the surface, refracting and scattering as it hits the water. You approach the surface slowly but surely, excited because you feel like you can finally exit into this warm, golden place, and leave the water behind.",0

"I even tried to settle this outside of their insurance so that their insurance rates wouldn't go up. I feel afraid every time it becomes nighttime and when I have to go to school, because I know there is a chance I may see him again. I don't know how to stop thinking about what happened that night, what I could have done differently, or what would have happened if someone had come to save me. It's hard to tell my family I've begun to think about killing myself again. I've struggled with depression for years and this incident has only made it so much worse.",1
"Some days I can't hear music from that time period, watch a show that's remotely emotional, or just sit without tearing up.

"Most of 2017, I stayed at around 135 and have been really good about hiding my fat with very flattering clothes but over the last 3 months, I have gained 15lbs as a result of traveling for work, moving to a new city and the holidays. I have always been very unhappy with the way I look and I envy girls who are slim. I obsess about this in my head 24/7 and even though I try to stay positive, the truth about how I REALLY feel comes out almost every time I go out drinking with friends and I become extremely negative and sometimes cry alone. My bf has told me that he is unhappy with my weight and he also hates seeing me unhappy. A summary of my bf: he is a complete workaholic, he loves me to death, he tells me how beautiful I am every day, he has dumped me 3 times because of my weight, he thinks I am an excuse maker and he does not know if he will commit to me.",1
"I want to note that I told my husband that if he came to me and told me for his sanity he needed to leave, I'd do it even if it was dumb for us monetarily. Nothing is worth him being tortured and putting pressure on our marriage. I think the reason we get by is because sometimes we can get away with once a day torture from my mother, she also helps us a lot (especially me) and some days are ok. He just feels harassed and I understand this more than anyone because I feel the same way. .",1

"My coworkers began noticing that was no longer their happy-go-lucky little teen, but a quiet and distanced serial-killer-faced old woman. I had become less focused and very accident-prone. I was losing my grip and they became increasingly worried about me. They automatically assumed that it had something to do with M; when I didn’t respond to them or look at them, their suspicions were confirmed. They told me that I should leave him, but said nothing and never took that advice.",0
"One friend went to the same college while the other didn't, but we still kept in touch. Obviously, that didn't go so well. For the friend in the same college, I thought that just asking her to meet up and talk would be nice, but I feel I was too persistent, and she broke all ties with me, asking me to never contact her again. The same goes with the other friend. I tried to keep in touch, but I guess my methods were totally wrong and creepy.",0
"Best friend knows I have anxiety and I am always asking her if she's mad at me. Well, yesterday she asked if I wanted to go to the beach next weekend, I said yes, and then today I told her I couldn't because I was supposed to watch my sister's kids. She wants to know why I don't take them with us. It's a two hour drive, and I really just don't want to go. But then she says that I always say no when she asks me to go somewhere with her.",0
"He certainly had/has the ability to. The worst/best part of this story is that I am still with this prick, trying to get away safely. Best part is that my story may be horrifying enough to convince women in an early stage DV situation to run before it escalates to my story. After the 2nd severe incident, I called family who took me to the ER. Had lots of tests done.",1
"This 100% stems from the abuse from my ex, and him training me to always be home. It home, go in my bed and lay there and watch some TV show or another while I'm on my phone.

"In Nashville, it's going to be below 30 tonight (possibly snow tomorrow). So far it seems my sleeping bag is doing it's job, but my laptop was uber cold.

"I'm sure as other survivors many of you are overcoming some of the same problems as well, and may have already had some of these realizations (of what makes you YOU) or are in search of them on your journey to becoming whole. It is crazy how DEEP these emotional scars and wounds are, that I literally cried way harder in this session, than in even processing waking up in a hospital bald! In this memory, I had post-partum depression right after my son was born and was living with Nmom and my Edad when they were still married 8 years ago. (I'm so grateful that they are no longer married. He is such an excellent parent/person NOW that he doesn't care about ""undermining her"".)",0

"I live alone, make sure my dog gets the exercise he needs, I keep my apartment tidy, I do my laundry, I make sure I’m eating good, I work out, and I still hang with friends and such. Really, the only time I play video games is after work (which is normally after 8:30pm) or when I’m off. Even when I’m off, I still do chores and such between playing games. Even though I’m good at getting this stuff done, I still feel like there’s this weight on my shoulders that I should do MORE. Even when I cut video games out of the equation (which I did for the last week and a half) I still don’t do MORE because I’m normally too tired to do anything else.",1
"Update: I’ve just got a response from my dad. His english is not the best, but he said, “I love you, and I know, you will think is a script love and is only letters but we both love you, time will create and demonstrate the my love was pure with a lot a mistakes as you see it and probably my eyes was block on times god night we love you"".

"My brother adopted me and enrolled me in the school his wife taught at. They had a family of their own and I was never treated the same as their children. My future friends referred to them as ""the Dursleys.""

They were also quite religious.",0
"I am unsure how to begin, but brief about me. I was a mess in my youth, half way houses, trouble etc, never got into drugs or drinking but did have a child young but her mother cheated then moved away, was sometime before we reconnected (she wanted child support and that was fine) but by this time I had moved to another country to get myself out of the existence I lived in. And this was going well, great career, started a family etc, all awhile building a long distance relationship with my eldest (not easy as they kept moving around). fast forward some years later, my eldest has attempted suicide due to many things but one being Aspergers making it hard for her young mind to cope with teenage hormones, so I made a choice to return to the US, to help her. I had to change careers, and try starting from scratch, brought my young family over and at first seemed all was fine.",0
"My mom is a single mom working two shifts every day and she cannot wrangle a full grown man like my brother anymore. So she lets him do what he wants as long as he can pay a small piece of rent. So he works with friends doing god knows what.

He makes SUCH A MESS everywhere he goes it's absolutely disgusting.",1
"My stress tolerance was already at a zero and I was contemplating suicide a lot, i didn’t want to see where that would lead me and I didn’t want to do that to my brothers. I was incredibly lucky and got referred to a good psychologist that I like. He’s helping me through the problems of getting rehabilitation welfare, which is a hassle because I constantly have to talk to new counselors, psychologists and psychiatrists which triggers breakdowns. I hate talking about myself to strangers, I’m not ashamed at all, I just hate having to share how I truly feel with strangers. It makes it so real.",1
"He was a diabetic with us. Never said much to him but he was a younger kid never caused a problem.

"I'm having problems with a friend and I thought an outsider's perspective might be useful. She's always been a bit overly emotional and controlling, having previously been very easy to anger, and having previously tracked me and an ex through my phone, and going through my belongings without my knowledge to check texts etc. It really worsened recently. Maybe a year or so arguments because a regular occurrence when we had been drinking.

I'm so afraid of people leaving me because I made them sad, I was mean, or I annoy them, anything, and they'll hold it against me even if I try to improve and make concentrated efforts to change. It's crippling. It's a catastrophic thought.",1
He went on rant (not aggressive) about how he worked all 50 something year's for the stuff he has and how everyone want to just thrown it away. And at that point I feeling like a gave up (it being 6 yrs to this day since I've graduated High school and grasped an idea). I currently want nothing from him. I still love my father and would do for him as he is still my dad but I don't trust him at all!! I did not mention the fact that he'll go through the garbage to see what me and my mother thrown out.,1
"I had poked fun at him for looking at /r/hentai or whatever a week or so ago, and I know I was pushing it too far, but I just thought it was amusing. I didn't think any less of him, and I told him that. I can understand him being embarrassed though. Anyway, last night I had been joking about looking at his browser history after seeing a recently viewed tab for porn. I figured it wasn't a big deal, since we both know each other's kinks and don't hide anything from each other (there's nothing worth hiding on either end).",0

And he got angry at me. He was yelling at me about how it was an accident he just forgot and all I do is bitch. When we got to the store we didn't even go in because he said I ruined his mood or whatever and we just went home. I cried all day. I just can't do it anymore and I'm so depressed and I'm so scared that I will end up going back to him.,1
"I suffer from depression and anxiety, I didn't have the courage to tell  him no.. Although he never hit me, I was never allowed my own bank card, I wasn't allowed my car keys... He yelled and cursed at not only myself but my young children too.. One day last week, he told my legally blind son to open his fucking eyes when he couldn't find his snow pants.... That did it for me, he was gone.",1
"I desperately miss my childhood and I wish I could have it back. After being molested, I feel that it was cut short.

I've been on so many meds, I feel like I'm at the point where I know what will work and what won't and she might as well written me a script for a sugar pill.

Do I blame her for being cautious? No.",1
"She has a temper and some anger issues. I'm the only one that has seen that side of her, maybe I'm just the cause.

I had pictures which the officers asked to see, which I showed them.",0
"But then I'll get there and he'll drop the bomb that his GF is coming over and to be honest, it totally makes me want to bail early.

How can I talk with my buddy in a polite way about the matter, that when he invites me over I'd prefer it to be bro time without coming across as an asshole or that I'm against his GF as a person which I'm totally not! Again, she's really sweet and he has every right to want his GF to come over to, I'm just tired of the surprise third wheel through the most goose bump inducing conversations and want some strategies how I can communicate with my friend that I don't like sitting through that. Thanks in advance!",1
I wasn't sure when I argued with him and she said that when him and I were breaking up and I asked if he still is attracted to me (and he had said yes but now I know otherwise) that is considered as arguing. I explained that I just wanted to understand because I was so thrown. She said that it counts as arguing and there is no point to ask him that and she built on that and said some other stuff that expressed that I am wrong to feel this way. I finally told her that I am sick and tired of being told that I cannot feel betrayed/hurt. I didn't stay at ex's place for an hour because we were arguing.,1

"I'm taking care of her but I have no idea what to do with myself. **TL;DR: My wife told her co-worker that she and I were in an open relationship and started hooking up with him.

But he never seems to be able to move on from the event from his past, or he‘s just deeply affected by his depression and negative thoughts, also all the stress from his studying in university and family really is a big problem.

"I saved picture after picture of him, had tweet and Instagram notifications on, tracked where his live band was, even looked up his house on Zillow once. I know I sound like a total stalker but I was just really obsessed and I regret everything I did now that I'm older and wiser. Anyway, when I was 16 I started writing fanfiction about him based on the very imaginative music videos he had starred in for his songs. It wasn't about him specifically, but rather alternate universe versions of him. I ended up doing this very bizarre thing where I romantically paired up two alternate reality versions of himself (long story, but basically I crave the gay).",0

In the past three days I have felt myself beginning to spiral and today I am feeling very very dark, very disconnected. I am such a low dosage I am wondering if maybe it's just not working and what I thought was it working was actually just reducing the alcohol intake?

Just wondering if anyone with any experience in talk therapy would share anything she may be able to talk about or focus on that could help a lot?

"I have been living in <location> at a homeless shelter run by the Salvation Army since the beginning of February (I know it hasn't been that long but still), and I started a new job a month or so later around the beginning of March. I don't know if my boss did a google search of the address I have on record or maybe drove past it one day, but I overheard him talking to another one of the staff about how 'the homeless population here in Toronto is getting pretty bad, and how there might be a lot once the weather improves because of the people trying to leave the USA because of Trump' And since I heard this conversation, I went from having 3 shifts of 4 hours per week (12 hours per week), down to this week I have 1 shift that's only 3 hours, and he's blaming how our sales are really slow, which they are down by an average of 4% compared to last year according to the reports that are printed automatically each day.

So I’ve only had ptsd for about 5 years now after a near death experience and I just want to know if you guys think it is possible for me to be able to get rid of it for good. That fact that I was not born with a generalized anxiety disorder really makes me believe that one day I’ll be able to be the person I was before the incident.

Both girls had quit a couple of months into their jobs, even though they were doing well, seemed happy and very much liked their positions. He told me that both girls had complained a few times to him that Pedo had grown very attached to them and made them feel very uncomfortable, but didn’t know what to do because he was their boss.",0
"You aren't weak. If you were weak, you wouldn't be fighting. I honestly don't know what inspired me to post this as I don't post here ever. This is obviously an alt, but I just wanted someone to hear if anyone. We're all going to get through this.",0
Im at a point where I need to talk to him about so many things but I cant if he continues to avoid me. I feel like a mess and any advice or help is really appreciated!   --- TL;DR Boyfriend and I have communication issues and he now left for two days and wont respond to any calls or texts. Any one know what I can do to help myself not go crazy and fix these issues.,1
"It sucks because I work on a computer and type all day at work and do needlepoint and sewing as a hobby and I can't do those things when it's this bad. Of course when people (family, coworkers, friends) see the brace they ask what happened. I always blame carpal tunnel. I feel so angry that I am still covering up for my abuser. I am angry I can't e joy my life without him showing up randomly.",1
"Yo, straight up. I am so goddamn sick of it. Yeah, its fine, I will wake tomorrow and do the work moving forward, but life is honestly the most pointless bullshit ever. Tomorrow my social worker comes. I just got rejected for a program I was kind of counting on.",1
"I've Shazamed it, I googled it. When I had a podcast, I even asked my listeners if any of them could tell me any information about it. Nothing. So now I'm hoping someone out there knows anything about the band, the song title ( my guess is that it's called ""The Bus"") The song is <url>",0
"All of these things I think contributed to this being a less traumatic experience than the first birth. Just before the second birth, she kind of lunged towards our first kid in the road, which, we later learned, gave her symphysis pubis dysfunction <url> She actually had substantial back/neck/joint pain (more on this later) in the first pregnancy as well, and this was worse, causing her to need crutches for the remainder of the pregnancy. This is not a super uncommon thing for a woman to experience <url> which includes my favorite-ever Wikipedia “For [alternate related article], see...”), but for most women, it resolves itself quickly after the baby is born. For my spouse, it didn’t, and she started seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist. This maybe helped, maybe didn’t.",0
"She tells me and her friends constantly about how this girl gives her butterflies, feelings of love, and worries out loud if she's gay/bi. Her boyfriend knows about this, since she talks to anyone she can about her life. He's a huge pushover though and doesn't seem to care allows her to continue texting and stalking this girl's social media profile. I'm okay with my sister exploring her sexuality, but I'm upset she's doing this to someone who takes care of everything for her. But he's okay with it, so is it any of my business?",0
"She embarrass him in front of others. Last weekend was really what made me decide to write this. Jay, Marie, me and the husband were at another couples house. We were drinking and playing board games but Jay had to work the next day so he stopped early. Marie starts taking this personally for some reason and then says to all of us that he’s “always ruining her nights out”.",0
"It is having a major strain on our relationship as he obviously wants to be involved but essentially I am unloading all my worry onto him. I am really unsure how to move forwards from here. If I think I am being irrational and hold in my anxiety, he says I am not communicating with him about it. If I open up and tell him, I feel like I am a burden and it makes me feel guilty and pretty low that I'm feeling this way. Any advice would be appreciated!",1
Maybe anyone with a history of abuse or trauma can tell me if there are particular things to be sensitive to here: I tried to be supportive but obviously failed in the end here. She's talking about wanting to divorce me. We're looking into couples therapy. I really appreciate any insight or advice. **TLDR**: Wife is working on an art piece that is important for her career in the arts non-profit world.,1
"I'm male and i live with my partner of 4 years. We have a 12 month old baby boy who is a very loved and cherished child. Early on in our relationship there were a couple of events that looking back i should have treated as red flags, basically my partner reacted volcanically to some fairly normal behaviour on my part such as messaging with a female friend (actually wife of one of my old mates) and me trying to arrange to meet my friends from home for beers (i live a couple of cities away from my home town). I wrote this stuff off as isolated incidents and we eventially bought a place together and decided to start the family we'd both always dreamt of. The pregnancy was kind of a beautiful bubble of love and anticipation and i was (and still am) elated by the arrival of our little boy.",1
"She and I are gamers, and we both play similar games together often. It was a part of our bond. However, looking back, her relationship to the game was extremely obsessive. Moreso than anything I've seen. She literally did nothing but play that game in the weeks leading-up to the assault.",0
"I get intrusive memories, that are really hard to get out of my head, sometimes I actually flashback like I'm there. I have nightmares that replay old memories of me as a child, or sometimes of just her face. But it doesn't happen everyday. This is the first time I've really thought about frequency, I'll catch myself actively trying to avoid thinking about certain things. I stay away from where I used to live with her, every time I go to that town I have a panic attack.",1
"The real irony is that had my dad told the truth about the car, he would be home right now plotting his next scheme, but instead he lied and got caught because of his arrogance. The problem we face now, is that there is always the chance my dad might sign the documents and they let him out (he'll probably weasel money out of his youngest brother/my uncle to pay the bail), and then we have to contend with the possibility my dad has something else planned to get us, which he probably does because that's his gig and his only goal in life since his big revelation after the pace maker got put in. My dad cannot talk to Bart or Dandy because they are witnesses, and he can't have any communication with my mom either. Myself and my brothers are contemplating getting a restraining order of some kind, but given how my dad operates, I'm not sure that will actually protect us from any harm. I have an appointment with doctor Doorstall this thursday, probably won't get anywhere but I'm sure he is aware of my dad's situation by now, or will be soon.",1
"I know it's a young relationship, but it's hard adjusting to changes especially since i went from seeing him every day to not seeing him at all anymore. If any one has experience with a PTSD relationship or something along those lines, please feel free to share.

"Regardless, that didn't last long, maybe half a year. I released that apartment, and most of my belongings (I kept a few boxes of my things from the military, personal effects, but little else). Looking back, there were some signs of emotional manipulation here, but it was subtle... and you know how it is, love is blind. We got engaged. It was quite the affair.",0
"Where do I go with this kind of shit? I'm not violent or suicidal, so the hospital is a no go. But I don't really know where you seek help outside the ER. I dunno the process, how you set up organized appointments, how you pay (got insurance however), don't know any of it All I know is the shit I've seen really affects me to the point where I have a home and a job yet still feel so disconnected from normal society",1
"I kept my head up and demanded the respect I deserve. I was very polite and expect the same. She wasn’t, so I put her in her place (she reprimanded me for leaving my gowns hung up in the dressing room). I came back to try on another gown and she goes you could at least bring them back. Mind you I have a one year old in my cart....",0
"It’s really kind of ruining my ability to empathize with some people Bc of comments they’ve made in the past. I witnessed the attempted suicide of my sister and then subsequent self harm targeting just towards myself for the purpose of manipulation and dealt with no one believing that it happened. So many people have told me be happy it was a failed attempt, failing to recognize the damage knowing someone I love could want to hurt me so badly did. Not to mention other abuse I dealt with after that. Trauma shouldn’t be a competition.",1
"I didn't do anything during spring break, except maybe go to work. And even then, I missed a day because I just couldn't deal with the stress. Most adults get excited to tell you they did absolutely nothing during their break. And there was a time when I enjoyed taking a break too. But now it seems like every time I have a break or a day off from work, it makes the stress worse.",1
"I meant this stuff, and I think I still sort of do. The reason I've been so angry recently is just the general stuff with my family, but also my dad specifically. He's been awful to me in the past couple of days, everything I say or do no matter how good I'm trying to be is bad and horrible and stupid, and if I disagree with him even slightly he gets angry. But I think I might deserve it. I feel like a bad person.",1
"Hi everyone, and thank you in advance for reading. I moved my family from Texas to Colorado thinking I had a new job lined up on the other side - this job fell through. Fortunately I have a new job starting January 23rd, but I don't have enough in savings to carry me through. We are running very low on necessities like bread and milk. I am unable to go to the local food banks because I still only have a Texas DL, I can't afford to transfer my license or vehicle registration.",1
"Bit of background... My abuser was my mother's father, let's call him J, because he doesn't deserve the title Grandpa. My mother's mother was H, because she didn't like us kids and doesn't deserve the title grandma. Between 1987 and 1989, I would stay at J's house for up to a week at a time and every night he would come into the room to abuse me. It always centered on sexual humiliation.",0
"One of my closest friends was recently diagnosed with stage II Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The problem though, is that needs help paying for treatment. She lives with a single parent, and can't work anymore due to her disease. Her health condition isn't in completely dire straits like some others on here, but it will be very tough to pay for chemotherapy and the ER visit that led to her diagnosis Any contribution would help, or simply sharing through Facebook or spreading the word is also great. <url>",0
This week has been bad. I'm crying over everything. I'm struggling at work to get basic tasks done. I am SO HEAVILY OVERWHELMED by the smallest things. My sink was so full of dishes to the point where I had no clean ones left and because the pile was so high I couldn't go near it and just cried.,1
"First off I'm male but my relationship with the woman is strictly platonic stemming from professional, we are co-workers. It's no secret to anyone that she's in an abusive relationship as she's come to work several times over the last several months with blackeyes etc and admits to being abused. She been in the relationship for 1.5 years which turned   info is out of the way, here's the new twist that has brought me to split roads. Yesterday she showed me a text from him detailing how angry he'd been at her 12 yr old and that if he didn't have so much will power he would have choked her son to death and that she needs to get her son to behave so he doesn't have to crack his skull. I encouraged her to show that to Leo and have him removed from the apartment as well as get an order of protection, she seemed to be considering that but has expressed fear of retaliation in the past.",1
"Suddenly she snaps and goes ""I fucking hate my brother, he is the biggest piece of shit ever, I couldn't care less about him"" and just started going off. Now, I know her brother can be pretty psychotic and from what shes told me he clearly has anger issues and the rest of her family keeps ignoring it, sometimes even enabling it. So 2 minutes into her exploding, she starts crying because apparently her brother told their dad something and the dad called her and said he doesn't trust her anymore or whatever. She was very upset about the dad thing because she's very close with her dad and she's her dads favorite child (he told me that himself when I spoke with him). I didn't want to pry too much because I felt like it isn't exactly my business of their internal family issues, but my girlfriend screenshot the text messages her brother sent her and I just could not comprehend how a human being, especially a sibling, can say that to someone.",1
"We were living together and life was pretty sweet. But she's my ex for a reason, right? In any case, the last two years after college got rough eventually. We were both working and things just piled up in the worst possible way. We didn't agree on how to take care of a pet.",0
"This means I also found it never quit heroine, but it was doing drugs behind my back. I even asked one time if it still did drugs and it lied to my face. However, it also had the audacity to question my loyalty and asked if i was hanging out with it to entertain my friends. What kind of time do you think I have... Figured out it was a covert narc abuser down to a T.",0

"I have extremely depressed and yes I've thought about suicide, but my family needs me alive, they need me or they may die, it's very dire where they live. I need pointers on how to find a good city to be homeless in, how to obtain a mailing address so I don't lose my SSDI (they've already pulled the stunt of ""you have 10 days from this mailing to respond or you are kicked off of SSDI, give us your last 5 years records) they've done this 4 times already in the past 10 years. I've been rejected for DSS services, no food stamps, I'm losing medicaid (but still have medicare, for now), no housing help (waiting list here is years), and only one agency is still willing to help me, a job agency, and the workers there are very distraught over my situation as they've tried very hard with me to help me get a good job. I have about 10 solid skills but I keep getting turned away and we cannot figure out why? I don't use drugs or alcohol, haven't even smoked weed since a teen and I'm about 61 years old.",1
"Does anyone have any experience getting a support animal? Ever since my sister's cat purred on me when I was having a panic attack, I've been thinking a cat could be good for me. But how do I find a cat that already is or can be trained to detect when I'm anxious or depressed or having ptsd flashbacks and come cuddle with me and purr and make me feel better. Can I get one that's already trained or how would we train one? We prefer to rescue animals instead of buying from breeders, but how do we train?",0
"Eventually he did it less. He would also make direct eye contact with me when he was seducing my mother, which filled me with so much rage. This happened throughout my adolescence. He acted hurt or offended because I always had my guard up around him. After I moved out to go to college, he let me know I wasn’t welcome to stay at their house anymore because I “treated them like shit”.",0
"I'm feel when I read about sth or learnt sth and I talk loud about that I feel I'm fake. I have this feeling that I try to impress someone or my knowledge is shallow and in fact I don't understand this or that well so actually I pretend and I always waiting for someone to laugh at me or correct me. In fact I feel like a shallow person with lack of knowledge \(even basic\) and I myself against me by judging I'm fake, it's not importan what I know or think and generally it's funny when I'm serious because I'm so kiddo what could I know what real life is and how can I know anything. because of that experience most of the time I am full of anxiety and barely leave my house. I was even too anxious to post online.",1

"I'm 26. Tuesday is day one of therapy. Day one of me trying to talk about whatever has been going on in my head for the last decade, last 2 decades. I'm terrified to talk but tired of living like this. Tired of the nocturnal panic attacks, tired of crying in the shower, tired of not feeling in control of my head, tired of the pointless thought circles that eat me up daily on something that doesn't matter.",1
"He is (objectively) pretty unlikable- only talks about himself when speaking to you- but you know, I try to see the best in people and ignored it when I talk to him. He claims he is bisexual. He introduced me to his lab partner, my current girlfriend, and I asked him if he was interested before pursuing her. He stated clearly no. Fast forward three months, it is winter break, and they are hanging out a bit frequently.",0
"My sister is an alcoholic as well and also drinks too much, tho not as much as this fellow. I've never been comfortable with the level of her drinking or her personal choices and I live long distance from her. I try to nudge her in more positive directions and in the past 18 months have been offering a few hundred in financial support monthly to her to help her better provide for her kids. About 6 months ago, it came out that her boyfriend has been screaming in her face and laying his hands on her. Usually she beats him up as much or worse - I think it's pure insanity and I told her that she needed to make physical contact a 'red line' and if I heard about it, I would call the local police office and report him.",0
"I am really worried about my future as it feels my anxiety always has me quitting jobs or having issues while I was in school. I can't even travel and work out of state as last time I tried I missed my interview and was nearly hospitalized with severe anxiety (travel is a trigger for me). I just got out of college and I'm really worried about how I can survive the working world in my future, otherwise I wouldn't care about losing this job. It hurts though and I feel like a total failure... Thanks for reading.",1
"I'm an adult with a mental illness, went through a messy breakup with an unhealthy ex that I thought was  the one and was in a codependant relationship with, I felt like I was letting him use my body by the end of it. I have ended up  basically non functioning, isolated, living on couch eating take away once a day for the last 10 months. Started staying at my parents intermittently in November, having a rough time processing stuff with my ex. Cue four days of remembering incidents of inappropriate sexual touching from my father when I was a child. Non stop.",1
"We talked for almost 2 hours that night and she insisted that she didn't want to end things, just wanted to slow it down for a while until she was comfortable. She told me she had just gotten out a relationship before we met, and didn't intend to have such strong feelings for me and now she is just scared. I actually ended up really liking her which has been rare for me lately, so this is something i would like to hold on to if at all salvageable. The problem is we barely text (once a week or so), and have not hung out since that party. Is this a case of 'Just not that into you' so she's just trying to be nice?",0
"As I kid, I had been pretty anxious and nervous, but they were negligible. I only got anxious when there was something happening, like giving presentation etc. They did not tamper with my everyday life and I was not concerned with them. But recently, I felt like my anxiety has developed into a new level. I got so damn anxious for every day stuff.",1
We went home the next day. And now i fcking dont know what to do. My heart rate feels like it’s shaking the whole bed. Im dying. TLDR i got friendzoned at the beach and I cant take it like a man,1

So now I just stay home and go on my computer all day. I leave the house maybe twice a week. I have constant feelings about being useless and that I'd be better off dead.",1
When we are at work we joke around but we all do that. I feel so ashamed. I want to hear your opinion on the fact am i to blame? Was it my fault because something like this happened? **tl;dr**: Something delicate happened between me and my collegue,1
"she then tells me i’m self centered and i’m a fuck up and i’m fucking my sister up. And once everything has been said 10 mins later she acts like she did none of it. she asks me if i want tea and to watch tv with her. this all probably sounds so confusing but it’s mentally making me lose it. i cant do this anymore, i can’t balance school and my personal issues and family issues and her altogether.",1
I go to the VA and I see people who need it more than me. I make a good living and only want to get on with life. Plus I know filing a claim at the VA is humiliating and I don’t want to go though what others I fear have. Thanks for listening. I posted this as there was a guy on the foxnews site dogging people with fake PTSD because his son served in combat and is fine.,0
"Am I sick? The dreams got worse. My mother felating me and soaping me in the bath.

That is my nightmare image burned into my mind.",1
"I have never before felt so betrayed by the system. Fiance (f) was blackout drunk. She started getting physical by grabbing my genitals and pulling so hard I now have a 1.5"" tear in my scrotum.. after that I was punched, bitten, scratched, and kicked over the next 5 minutes. All I could do was try to retreat, but I was unable to get to our room so I could get dressed and leave the house (I was nude at the time). As I got scared she would seriously hurt me, or I would strike her back, I grabbed my phone and dialed 911.",1
"Plus she sent him pictures of her ultrasound. Now I'm just heart-broken because I was head over heels for this guy and I'm also disgusted by what he did to this girl. I don't know how to confront him about this or how to handle this situation properly. I am going to break up with him, but what do I do after I end it? Do I tell his fiancee?",1
"Her parents didn't know about me at this point. I kept this bottled in for a long time, but exploded and was ready to break up with her over it but she said she would stop being in touch with him. She claims he has mental issues and had threatened numerous times to commit suicide. If I take her at her word, there was no sexual contact between them after we started dating. This contributed to me not trusting her.",1

"Havnt had one in years. After it was done i couldnt stop thinking about what if it was actually a brain tumor. What if im going to die a slow and painful death?

I'm overwhelmed looking at all the options on amazon. Has anyone found something that works for them? Any ideas for other subreddits I should redirect my question to?

"The first two times I had done these psychedelics I was mostly alone, the last one however was with my friends. So me and two of my closest friends (let's call them Joseph and Andy) took our tabs in a pretty comfortable setting (as has been suggested by most who have taken these drugs). It was at Joseph's apartment. About an hour later Andy has definitely been hit the strongest with him being the most talkative and I the least. The visuals were amazing as usual and the sound is also distorted as usual.",0
"We get no child support and are doing well financially without it and although he is supposed to pay, I leave it alone because he leaves us alone. Long story short, I didn't file or ask for supervised visitation, but that's what the courts ordered. He did that two or three times within a year and haven't heard from him since. This Friday for the first time in years I realized how much my life has changed and how happy I and my children are. Then, of course, I get the curve ball of this message on Saturday evening.",1
"I go through periods where all night I have nightmares and I can’t slee because of them. These periods last for weeks or months on end and then stop briefly. Three years ago I used to be on a medicine that helped with the nightmares, I can’t remember the name though. It was a really old blood pressure medicine from the fifties that they gave to soldiers returning from war and they figured out that it helped with ptsd too. But it made me so tired.",1
"Reddit, I need some quick advice about a situation I just encountered. Over the weekend I went home to visit my parents and within this time new neighbors moved in right next to me at my apartment complex. I come home from work and take a nap, but then wake up to a child's screaming and crying. Right after this, I hear a smack as our units have paper thin walls. I'm pretty sure I shouldn't have announced myself and just called the police, but I was so angry at the thought of what was going on next door I went over and pounded on their door.",1
"She never really felt the need to do that and occasionally would go out with her friends. Everything was great -- I took care of her extremely well, she took care of me patiently and amazingly. I bought her a car, paid for her rent, and ultimately supported her so she could focus and finish her college (I'm full time employed, the breadwinner in the relationship). Our relationship was VIVID and full of color in the beginning. We had our own apartment, got a beautiful dog together, and traveled to a few places.",0

I feel like I can be that person for my girlfriend since I love her but I don't think I want to sacrifice my happiness for that. I just want to have a simple life and find someone who will have time for me. I didn't grow up in a loving family like her. It's not always about money. I grew up comfortably but there is not much love in the family I grew up in so money isn't important to me.,0
"Are there any recommendations I should bring up with my doctor?

"But i think the worst part is her emotional abuse. Like having fun to make me scared or cry and also always putting me down like i am not good enough or ignoring me. Also i feel like she is sexually attracted to me (i am 17 now) and uses some shitty pretending to touch me between my legs or butt. I once tried to talk with my dad about it, but he said that he and mom have enough to do and i should pull myself together.

She then went on with how she did like me, thought I was an interesting and nice person. but I do not believe that, it is too unlikely. Besides, as an addendum to her refusal to speak to my question, it seemed false.",1
"Mostly, I think I just want a mom. I've been struggling with anxiety really bad, and a lot of it has to do with my relationship with my boyfriend. This is my first boyfriend. He's a senior at a different college. He lives in the city that I go to school in.",1
I wonder about that night. Did you ever get past that night? Did you have other nights like that? Did anyone ever ask if you were okay? Do you forgive me?,1
"I relate to a lot of the symptoms, but what happened to me wasn't ""life threatening"" it was more of a childhood trauma that has a lot to do with growing up in a chaotic home. My brothers tried to kill himself twice, (TRIGGER WARNING: SUICIDE) and that vision of him holding the knife to his throat or choking himself with a belt WILL NEVER GET OUT OF MY HEAD. hence the reason I'm typing this at two am. It's really bad today and I have gotten zero sleep since midnight of last night. I just can't shake those images out of my head EVER.",1
"I know what it means to dive into oneself. I asked him and he confirmed its a deeper variant. I got excited. There’s no switching out of consciousness, you can reject what he says, your totally in control (or so he’s telling me :)). So the first part was getting me deep, through counting, dropping my hand and other techniques I went deep.",0
"Hi, I am 21 years old, I used to suffer from panic attacks and anxiety last year, but somehow managed to beat it and live like a normal person again. But from time to time, i have this weird feeling that I am gonna pass out or something like that, my face is pale and I feel this uncomfortable pressure in my eye balls, it happens when I'm at university during class or even during normal daily activities. I did some blood tests and everything is fine, so is this anxiety again?",1
"I keep getting this... creeping/moving feeling in my stomach. Right below where my ribs part, maybe slightly to the right. I have no idea what it is but I've never had stomach issues with my anxiety. It just started in the past couple of weeks. Admittedly my anxiety has been a lot worse lately.",1
I need to start setting some healthy boundaries and cut these people out of my life. I just do not know where to start because they are family but I have three girls that are growing. I cannot have them involved with these monsters. My children will know a different world. Do I tell my father or just fade slowly into the abyss and never look back?,1
The last straw that broke me completely happened the night before/early morning of St Patty's day 2013 (age 21). I went to a bar for a pre-party. I had one shot with the bartender and some other guys there. I then started drinking water and talking to the guy sitting next to me. He said he was a pilot.,1
"I keep getting sudden, very short panic attacks. Or anxiety attacks. I'm not sure if I feel fear, I don't even know what the feeling is because I forget everything short term afterwards. They last a presumably short amount time and is the worst feeling imaginable to me. Some random thought I can never remember triggers it (it's definitely something that repeats though, it's a familiar feeling afterwards).",1

"I just can't do it. Some days I think: ""You know what, i'll do it!"". But I never actually did it. There's a fucking huge wall, a Trump wall, stopping me. All I wanted was a job, now I got a job offer but the wall is stopping me.",1
"This was literally the first meal I've had with other people in nearly a year. This couple was young enough to be my children and I could picture myself in their situation which I pray will never happen, but if it does I would really hope someone would buy me some food every once in a while. The guy seemed a bit sheepish, but the woman seemed a bit more comfortable with being homeless. They seemed like decent enough people and I don't regret buying them food, but towards the end of our meal the woman said something to the guy about getting home by midnight. But I thought they were homeless!?!",0
"&#x200B; Hey everyone, Being that Hurricane Florence just occurred less than a month ago, my  personal experience with Hurricane Florence consisted of having my  maternal extended family evacuated from Craven County and coming to stay  with my family in Wilson, having to have family members be rescued from  their home due to a severe flash flood, and dealing with the shock and  emotions of loss once returning. On top of that, two of my family  members have been displaced and all of them are still in the stages of  recovery. This is the first natural disaster that has left a major  impact on my family as far as trying to find resources and dealing with  insurance adjusters and etc.",1
"Eddie can think back to being 10 at the farthest. I can access very little memories of us being younger than 10, but it's few and far between. Our therapist asked us collectively to try and ask our brother what our childhood was like growing up. I feel like we cannot...do that. We aren't exactly close to Eddie's brother as much as he wants to be, so asking this kind of serious stuff could result in nothing being figured out.",0
"Picked music up again and I'm considering the possibility of doing it for the rest of my life rather than science, which is what I've been led by my environment to believe is my ""destiny."" Even if I am coming to plenty of realizations, I constantly ponder about our relationship, how horribly it ended, and whether I may have done something wrong and how I can fix a bad quality in myself that made things end that way. I just want to forget. Is this horribly written? I think so.",0
"I am currently only using 5-htp once a week, i get no benefit when i use it daily. I have also been working out which has inevitably eased my depression and made my anxiety more tolerable but its still obviously taking hold of my life. Well here i am at this present moment, I have been contemplating having a sit down with my parents and telling them about my depression (pretty sure they already know, they just don't want to adress it). It had been hard, my parents come home at 9:00 PM and don't want to be bothered with me. they go straight to their rooms and the only time they are willing to talk is when they tell me to clean.",1
"I'm a freshman in college. I had to move out asap due to a volatile home situation, and I'm still struggling with finances and figuring out the real world. I just got a job, but am currently extremely sick, and worried about starting. Even so, my phone bill is due and I won't be paid for a few weeks. Student loans don't come in until January.",1
"My life has spiralled into a area I’m not sure I can survive in much longer. Everyone who was close to me have seemingly all decided to just pretend I don’t exist right as I start my third year of Uni. My anxiety levels are usually pretty high this time of year but this last month has been the worst of my life for my emotional well-being. I’m trying so hard but I’m suffering, and the meds don’t seem to be helping What do I do",1
Some monsters are real. I was abused by some as a kid and I was recently reminded that they are still out there. I sometimes manage to find myself in reddit threads with discussions about pedophilia. It bothers me to see people defending pedophila and I often feel the need to respond. I think it seemed a safe way to vent anger at surrogates for my abusers and I think I wanted a chance to say what I never had the chance to say as an abused kid.,1
"She does dissociate and is on all kinds of psychiatric meds. One day she loves me the next day she hates me. I really don't know what to do, I moved down south to be with her and so I have no friends or family here. She suffers from  agoraphobia so we never leave the house. Its also her place so Im scarred she is going to kick me out, she has used that against me in the past, it makes me feel very vunrable and scared.",1
"Hey, So I come from a middle class family and study far away from my parents for university (already scary for me as you can imagine). After going home this winter my parents dropped the bombshell on me that they are struggling to pay my tuition. The thing is, although we are not super rich or anything, my fathers work covers 80% of my tuition and housing, the reason that my parents are unable to pay is that my dad is fairly disorganized and let his expenses build up. My tuition is due this friday and I just called my parents and woke them up to inform them that its getting really serious now (my dad promised to make an arrangement with his friend to pay my tuition).",1
"Do you think she's just trying to let me down easy or that there might be something but she's just not ready? Everybody I work with says she likes me. Her close friend from work even said something similar. I'm probably over thinking this, as I tend to do. What do yall think?",0
"I loved this person dearly with all my heart, and it was an extremly tragic and sudden death. I want to go to my doctor but im already in counceling. Ive only gone once and my next visit is on wednesday. Should I tell my greif councellor? Thanks for reading.",1
Any advice is welcome. I'll be checking in and replying to comments as much as I can but I have to be discreet so I may not be able to answer for a while. Thank you in advanced. Tldr: I was ready to move out then my car broke down and he is now fixing it. He doesn't know I'm leaving as soon as he's done and I feel terrible about it because he's actually being nice for a change and is trying to stay sober.,1
I once went to the hospital and needed hand surgery so I messaged her when I found out and said “hey mom I’m in the hospital I’m having surgery tonight thought I would let you know.” She never came to visit and she never even asked what kind of surgery it was. What do I do? I feel like I’m nothing but I burden and I just wanna disappear. I rebelled and did my own thing as a teenager because I was so hurt from what I had been through is it normal for her to hold it against me? She just sees me as the fuck up causing her annoyance.,1
"This internet ban subsequently resulted in me failing my studies, and in turn lead to my parents despising my relationship. Needless to say, they had noticed a huge change in my personality on top of failing my studies. I want allowed to speak to these friends either. She worried that they would be finding ways to show porn to me, and made them out to be terrible friends, which I of course believed. I failed to mention how incredibly good she was at manipulation.",0
"Why did I have to scream in pain? Sometimes the bashings would be so bad that I would call my mum while she was at work [sometimes my brother and I would be home alone after I returned from school, when he would torment and bash me]. I would run into my room and lean against the bedroom door with all my weight while my brother kicked and punched through it from the other side. Once, the wood splintered and went into my back. Still no-one stopped him.",1
"It was a big company so luckily I didn't have to see him all the time, but when I did, he again acted as though I didn't exist. I tried to talk to him and update him on the pregnancy, and ask him to be involved for our child's sake, and he literally stared right through me without saying a word. 3 months after our daughter was born, I texted him and told him he was missing out on the most amazing person in this world, and how it wasn't fair to her. To my surprise, he wrote back and wanted to see her. He apologized, said he had changed and within a couple of months, we were engaged.",0

"Hi reddit. I never thought I would need to post anything here, but over the weekend, tragedy struck people that are very close to my heart. This request is not for me, but for some close family friends. Saturday night my friends were on their way home from their baby shower. They were hit by a drunk driver with a previous DUI and a suspended license.",0
"She requested to go to the bathroom right away, and we helped her with that. The husband/driver was out loading all our parts when she finally came out of the bathroom. We asked her what is wrong. She said, ""He grabbed me by the neck and hurt me. I don't think I can go back with him.""",0

"Hello, I'm 22, female and from the UK. I'm kind of freaking out right now because I think something happened to me as a child. I don't even know, I'm sorry I wish I had something concrete to say but I don't think I could even type it out. The problem is I've recently moved to Japan on my own and have no one to talk to here. I would normally talk to my boyfriend but he's not awake and I don't even know what I'd say to him - I don't even feel like I can say anything out loud even if I was with him.",1
"I know he's never going to be the same, but it's hard seeing him like this. He's become very wreck less, too. He's Hanging out with punks who think are big ballers selling Xanax and weed, living at there moms apartment. --side note: His friend was thrown out of a car recently during a drop off at gun point. My brother lashes out when things don't go his way to and just has a nasty attitude at times..",1
"I'm 33 years old and support and live my own life. My parents are in their 70s and retired. They always tend to worry, so this was something I knew they really couldn't do anything about so I didn't want them to worry for nothing. There's also just the mental health stigma and as a guy that makes it harder too. I also have a sister that I have never been very close to.",0
"My father has: Keys to a fancy car, like 5 fancy bikes, an iPad, member of a fitness center, goes to the sauna regularily, other women... Needless to say, they should just break up immediately, right? Well, it should be that simple, but my mother resists for some reason. We had this situation countless times, where she was like, I cannot cope with this anymore, let's find another place to live in, until you find something for yourself, and when things are about to happen, she goes nah, I don't know... Which is so frustrating to hear after a while. Even more so, when he says things like HE decides when or if they split up.",1
Kick a man while he's down you sick sick fuck. I'm just trying to get advice and you delete part of my post. FUCK YOU. BURN IN HELL. People like you are why I hate this world.,1
"I sat her down and told her that she is ruining her chances of having a relationship with my husband by how strong she is coming on. I told her that she is pushing him away and making him uncomfortable. She seemed to take that to heart but then days later said, “this is just who I am.”  I've been working on ways to fix this; it just isn’t very successful. I will take my mom to therapy with me when our schedules work. **TONIGHT:**",0
"Alright so, for my entire life I've been a straight-A student. High honor roll every time. I never expected any less and neither did my parents, teachers, friends, etc. Over the past year (8th grade) I've developed anxiety, depression, and OCD. (Not self diagnosed.)",1
"I am writing a novel, based on my experience in an abusive relationship with my ex boyfriend. However, its not a precise retelling,  partially for my safety, but also because I want to tell not just my story but others' stories as well. Part of what makes good writing is having small specific details and the little stories that make up the novel as a whole. This is why I was hoping that, if you are interested, you could send me stories of your experiences in an abusive relationship - whatever detail you choose to send, it doesn't have to be anything ""epic"" and ""grand,"" it could be the smallest segment that you hold significance to. If you have any questions about what I'm looking for, let me know - though I'm really looking for anything!",0
"I don't want to leave my house because I know that everyone knows what she's saying about me and EVERYONE BELIEVES IT. this was all over the fact I blocked her because she was toxic.

"He backed me into a corner in the kitchen and kept hitting me. When I fell he stomped on my face and also choked me. I was trying to hit back but he's much bigger than me. When he starting choking me, I bit the holy hell out of his arm to get him off. He surprisingly did, after yelling about how it hurt, then went to finish packing.",1

"I loved that man so much and tried my best to make it work. But I have limits. And when he was not thinking twice about getting alcohol while we didn’t have even enough money left for milk for our baby, that was my limit. We had .51 cents in our account and he found that acceptable? !",1
So he hasn't really hit me since we got back together but he's cruel in so many other ways. He will call met fat ass (I'm 5ft8 and 130 pounds) and just had our third child.

I asked for a meeting with all of upper management so that I can start back up at work with clear boundaries for what I won't accept anymore.

"She also said that we may not be sexually compatible, and that its unfair on me if I stay with her and put up with it. I obviously told her I don't want to break up and she doesn't either. I offered her time alone and she was so unsure in herself that she didn't even know if she wanted to take me up on the offer. I said that I think we should wait until your appointment in March to freeze your ectropion, to see if that improves your libido. We ended up crying and cuddling each other.",0
"I have a twin sister, Audrey, and I hate her. I genuinely can't explain it. I know it's so irrational, but it's just how it is, and I hate that this is how it is. We both came home for our mom's birthday, and I couldn't even spend 20 minutes with her. We're really different people.",0
"It feels very weird to feel like you have nothing to cry about, then cry, and then go back to not being sad right after you cry....) I just don't get it....I thought stress was something that built up over time....like you hop from 5 -> 6 after a few months of continued stress...Is that not how it works? Does stress fluctuate between 1 and 10 on a daily basis? And how much do ""stress relieving activities"" actually help? I just cried does that mean I'll go from 7 to 5?",1

"But we didn't talk about it the morning after, and life went on. Over the next year, we would continue to stay up late at house parties or whatever the occasion was (until 3, 4, 5 AM) about once a month, and just talk and talk and talk, until we inevitably hooked up. Keep in mind he was still dating someone else. Eventually during one of these moments, I worked up the courage to indirectly get a pulse on his feelings. More or less, he said he thinks about me multiple times a day, which was different from anyone else he ""dated"" prior.",0
"I will always make strides to be there for others. To life my life if not to spite the voice behind my anxiety and take care of myself. I hope others struggling in this thread know that what is going on in your life is temporary...it will pass. “How do you know?” I’ve been at lower points in my life.

"Any problem he had, he would blame on me. If I didn’t take his side during an disagreement he was having with someone else, he would get so mad and start with the insults. I eventually got out of the relationship, and when I ended it, he began obsessively texting me up to 30 times a day, talking to my family and lying to them about what was happening, etc. He finally stopped when I threatened a restraining order. The last time we talked was in May 2017.",0
"My sister messaged me ""CALL ME ASAP"" I received her message at 1am when I woke up at my own home to use the restroom.

"It’s almost a 50/50 mindset, because on one hand she wouldn’t ever wish to be thought of or treated in a horrid way, I have corrected it best I can, and she is the kind of person to forgive and forget. It’s hard. It’s real hard to decide what to do. So that’s why I’m here today people of Reddit. I realize this isn’t the most pressing, serious, or dramatic post on here, but I stick my hand out in the hopes you can give me some guidance, some past experience, wisdom, or advice on what I can do or try so that the “here and now” are in question, and not “then and there”, so that my confession can go along without regret.",1
am I writing it because it looks crazy or am I writing it because it's how i feel?~~ Maybe I can't word things clearly because it's my deepest thoughts. I'm going to try to write clearly because I feel like a fraud. I don't even know how to begin. I don't know the questions to ask.,1
"I recovered somewhat after a few hours but somethings changed now; I cant be alone without constantly feeling like Im on the verge of another attack. When my fiance is home Im perfectly fine, but as soon as she leaves for work (I work from home) I start to feel terrified, my feet and hands start sweating, I feel like Im about to be sick, I get lightheaded and I feel like I become wayyyy too conscious of my breathing to the point where I focus on it and it feels like no matter how much I exhale and inhale Im not actually breathing. I dont understand why this is happening....Ive never had issues being alone; now I cant even be alone in my own home. This feels like my life is ruined if I dont get it under control because I cant work like this. What the hell is happening?",1
"They have changed since we first met. I don't feel attracted to the person they actually are compared to who they seemed to be when we first met. I know as you get to know people more, you learn more facets of their personality, but they just aren't a great person honestly... When we first met, they were incredibly sensitive and sweet. They portrayed themselves as a feminist (which is important, but not an end-all be-all for me), they were very in-touch with their emotions, and just came across like someone I'd love to be around.",0
"I debated for ten minutes what I should do. I didn't want to open the message completely and violate her trust that far, so I woke her up (which was a big decision because she loves sleep and has two tests today - I know I'm an asshole but she understands and doesn't want me going crazy while she sleeps), and yeah. That was that. She told the guy she was in a relationship (who doesn't check relationship status on Facebook ffs? ), and thanked him for creating a shitstorm.",0

"So to the point, I’m almost 30 and I’m starting to think maybe I *am* this anxious person who says stupid things and gives off the ‘Don’t mess with me’ vibe I apparently give off when I’m anxious. I’m painfully awkward. I unintentionally say really rude things and I don’t even realize it until way later. I’m socially inept and it’s frustrating that all this work I’ve continually been doing for my mental health has been for nothing. I feel like I should just succumb to accepting that the good times are few and far between and this person I am when I’m unstable mentally is just who I am.",1
"I also get really painful cramps/periods every month. I do not share this with the people I work with because I do not want to ""complain"" nor do I think it is any of their business!

"I worry that if I sit around too often, I will develop blood clots and die. Anything to do with death really. On top of that, I have been developing intrusive thoughts. But the worst part is that last week I was laying in bed and randomly became afraid that I was going to lose my sense of reality and start hallucinating. I have never hallucinated in my life (unless you count the 2 times that I tried psychedelics) and have never had this fear before but it scared the shit out of me.",1
"Certain things will make me feel uncomfortable. as of recently she will jokingly play with my nipples, like suck on them or biting them if we are laying in bed and I’m shirtless. This makes very uncomfortable and I don’t like it at all. I’ll laugh and tell her to stop and that I don’t like the feeling of it. She will keep jokingly doing so and tell me stop being a baby or that she is just joking around.",1

"Hi, everyone! Just a warning, kind of a long story, as you can probably tell from the paragraph. So my relationship with anxiety has always been a thing, at least from what I remember from childhood (undiagnosed OCD).

"Things got better in middle school (thankfully) but it’s sad how literally 5 years as a young child (when life was supposed to be good) were so rough and still affect my life to this day. My home life wasn’t super bad but school was a living hell. I was excluded from everything and still to this day I tend to view the world as harsh and unaccepting. Sorry for the rant, it’s just sad how cruel teachers and students can be in elementary school. Bullying in elementary school directly caused so many of my mental health issues.",1

And I know that if I had been in his position I would have done everything I could to help my partner and taken them seriously, regardless of whether I would have felt that way or as bad about something or not.",1
"I have a presentation to give on Wednesday as part of my Biology course. It's by myself and I've already jumped to ""would it be so bad if I didn't do it?"" because the thought of doing it feels worse than missing out on 20% towards the module... I can't see my doctor before then because there's no appointments and I tried getting an appointment with the counselling service that uni offers but they haven't got back to me yet. My heart races every time I think about it.",1
"He didn't remember, and didn't care that they weren't in the file any longer. He said he had 400 cases on his docket and couldn't remember something so trivial. He didn't care to look at my phone or email, because bond didn't matter when the case wasn't going to win. I started to feel like I was detaching and becoming defensive. The Prosecutor was aggressive, dismissive, and belittling.",0
"I feel terrible because we never do anything fun. We never go to the zoo or go to the movies because it’s usually too late and I’m too drained by the time I pick him up. Needless to say this lifestyle is absolutely killing me. I am miserable. I have zero friends, I see my wife a few hours a week because of our opposite schedules and I’m drained.",1
"But she's a nurse and works crazy hours, so it would just be too much for her, I think. I'm posting in case there's an option I'm missing. Any suggestions welcome. tl;dr: I have $$$ coming in, but the timing is off. Might be homeless for two weeks to a month.",0
"I do not want to hurt anybody. The therapist says it is self punishment, that I want these people to tell me what a piece of shit I am to verify what I already believe.

If it is unconscious, well I am getting sick of that idea.",1

"Won't have any income until after I graduate, so whatever I spend this shit on, that's it. I have no social life anyways, so I won't be missing out on anything since I just stay in my room when I'm not in class.

"I've been homeless for a couple days since my roommate completely screwed me by not paying rent for 5 months and hid notices from me. I only had a week to move out, and get things into storage. I was able to find a roof to sleep under for a short time but it's severely roach infested and I have to sleep on the floor. There isn't anything availible at my price range, certainly not on that short of a notice. I had a few prospects but they went to other people.",1
"A LARGE portion of each of my check goes to making payments to this card but with the interest charges each month I budgeted and itll take me decades to pay it off and cost me thousands. I was in a tough spot, jobless, homeless, and had to rely on the card but now I need to find options on how to pay it off or get a lower interest rate. I have heard of those advertisements about taking out a personal loan with a lower rate and using that to pay off the card then just paying the personal loan off, are those viable options? What is my best option right now, these interest rate charges are killing me and I can barely make ends meet. Any advice would be deeply appreciated",1
"Hi everyone I have GAD that gets much stronger/prevalent when I don't have enough sleep. Coincidentally, it also makes me unable to sleep sometimes, so kinda like a vicious circle. Normally, I don't really have that many problems with it but I just started a new fulltime job with a lot of responsibility and that triggered my insomnia and subsequently all the underlying fears. My doctor prescribed Xanax as a when-needed last resort but since I was really scared of withdrawal/addiction after reading up on the drug (it's not called Xanax here but alprazolam) I only started taking 0.5mg at night after really breaking down.",1
"I gathered my composure, went back and sulked until I was asked if I could put something in my eye sight to block it out. I got a little excited, found a huge box and was able to move on with my day.. until about 3 when the owner came over, moved it, and then asked me if I was keeping it for anything. I mentioned I was blocking the signs, she asked why and I said, well, I feel they are kind of negative... And then she told me ""They aren't negative, they are funny, and since you don't think so you should think on if you even want to work here"", walks away and proceeds to tell my boss it isn't working out with me........ all because I expressed that I felt the signs were negative. Stupid me for thinking dozens and dozens of instant in your face surprise red circles could ever equate to negativity.  I guess I have a new trigger.",1
"But it happened. I literally had to take breathing exercise thingys because I felt like I was gonna pass out, my heart was racing.

"To start, I feel like I should share why I wanted to be here today to read this statement myself. For six and a half years, I was in a relationship with Luis. The first time he physically assaulted me, I was 18. That was the first time I had been knocked unconscious by another human. The choking incident that we are here for today was the first incident of domestic violence that I reported to the police.",0
"I'm worried about my friend. She's really pretty and carefree and intelligent and I've known her since highschool. We had a band back then. She played guitar and sang, I played bass and another friend of ours played drums.

"Brian has exactly the same responses. I know he is in a nightmare because I am fully aware of his breathing, his perspiration and his heart rate (a gift of growing up as a small child being hunted, there are some skills that are animalistic that I retain to this day). His service dog, Sasha, no longer wakes Brian up from his nightmares but stands up stretches, which is enough to wake me up and if I don’t fix the problem, she will wander over to my side of the bed lay her head on it and make that condescending “get a move on with it woman” growl she has developed. She loves me in that I exist and am occasionally useful. Smile.",0
"Grad school isn’t really the easiest place to parent alone. Assistantships don’t pay you enough to live off of by yourself (Mine nets me a little less than $800 a month, rent is $750), let alone with a tiny human that needs a particular type of education. They also require you commit to 20 hours a week of on campus work. Essentially meaning, you can’t really hold a full time job anywhere. On top of this, working another part time becomes difficult because work hours have to coincide with the hours your little one is at school, and with 20 hours a week on campus already, that leaves little time to actually work anywhere else during school hours.",1

She would be coming to the states for the first time in over 10 years on Dec. 30. I was ecstatic to finally meet my MIL. We've chatted on several occasions and she is truly a great person.

"I was told by my peers, the media, so many things, that what I was doing was okay, was fine, was normal, was desired by every boy my age. I'm sure the majority of my abusers knew I was underage, how could they not? I told some of them how old I was, and most of the ones I told were okay with me being underage, although were extremely coercive, threatening, and frightening at times. I was constantly gaslight, verbally abused, and made to feel frightened and ashamed by many of these people, but I felt like I had to keep trying, like I had to be there to perform for them. All of the physical abuse (sexual and otherwise) that I've survived, happened after I turned 18, starting with my first REAL girlfriend, and the relationships that immediately proceeded her.",0

"Sally is around the same age, 25 I assume, (can’t confirm numbers, sorry about that) and she quickly became a red flag for me. He would mention her name occasionally and how our love for the same type of shows was shared with Sally. Sally and I met a few times. The first time was when we planned a day out shopping with a mutual friend who was single at the time and my bf decided to invite Sally. I thought that was a little weird, but justified it because 1) I had never met her and thought that would be a great opportunity to and 2) He said maybe the two of them would hit it off.",0
"If you were raped on a daily basis from infancy through adolescence then you should ""radically accept"" it. Check out the parts of Linehan's book where she explains how unconditional positive regard is a myth, nonexistent. The part where she explains about paradoxical intervention. That is where you manipulate and jerk your client around using head games and reverse psychology. Then there is radical genuineness.",0
"Not like triggers per say, because I'd have to ask her about that, but more general behaviors. Like, if I see her acting in a certain way that is common to abuse victims, I should know to be careful around that. Like apologizing a lot is a common behavior. Knowing about the abuse, I didn't try and correct her or anything (save one time when she thought she was bothering me, and I told her she will never be able to do that). So any additional information is useful.",0
I doubt and second guess myself a lot. I hesitate and fear picking up the phone. Fear coming off as too aggressive or too pushy or not sending the right person and Err On the side of not being aggressive enough.

I feel really bad about myself when it happens, sometimes I cry and other times I just have rage. I don't feel like I can talk about it with anyone. I could really use some advice on how to deal with these memories and emotions when they take over, or if any of you have found ways to stop memories from popping up?",1
"She has not once shown disappointment. When she sees me get frustrated, she lays next to me and holds me. Asks me what I need to relax.

"Then right after, said “do you think I made you feel like that ever?” Then got noticeably nervous. Which makes me think of one memory that sticks out as a child (I don’t have too many childhood memories, but I remember this one well). I was probably 3 or 4, and wearing purple underwear, and I’m pretty sure I fell asleep with pyjamas on, and then in the morning I woke up asking why I didn’t have pyjamas on anymore, and my dad and uncle said “you don’t remember? We came in when you were in bed last night and uncle _______ held you for a bit” and I remember being super confused because I didn’t remember that, and also, why would they come in and hold me when I was asleep? Anyway, that memory was weird.",0

" I just stop doing productive things, talking to people, remembering appointments,  etc. I am unemployed and almost broke but looking for work is causing me to feel like I can't swallow or get a full breath. I find that I have played video games all day, surfed Reddit or this morning I read reviews on a book that is coming out for almost 2 hours. I am not on meds though I am trying Gaba since I had some anyway. To make it even more fun, my sister is mad at me because I am ""chronically self centered"" because I forgot to get back to her about possibly getting together for dinner, because I am shut down.",1
"I keep trying, hoping we can be what we were...that the man I fell in love with will return. What’s happening here? Why rage at your wife when she tries to be affectionate?

"Some times it feels like my dreams will never go away. I have regular dreams about my ex. Usually a few dreams every week. Sometimes the dreams quiet down and some times they occur every night. He was abusive to the point where he tried to kill me while I was laying in bed one night, and he was very physically abuse  every other day.",1
"They're all things I enjoy doing and don't see as being that big of a deal, but she seems to perceive them as grand gestures. She regularly says that she ""doesn't deserve"" someone as ""perfect"" as me (which yes, she does, she's amazing, and also I'm not even that great, just moderately thoughtful) and has also said that ""because of past experiences, I have trouble liking people who I know like me... I guess it's more rewarding to feel like I've ""earned"" the validation."" In short, it seems like because of her past relationships, she kind of has an unhealthy mentality around 'earning' affection, and definitely has some sort of commitment issues (apparently her last ex said that he didn't really love her for the last year of their relationship, but was too afraid of hurting her to break up with her). All of this makes me ambivalent about broaching the topic of a committed relationship with her because I don't know how she'll react, but at this point we've both admitted we're falling for each other.",0

"We were doing so good.” I’m feel as if I can’t be angry at any of his actions, and my words mean nothing,  and my threats are empty. He makes me feel so horrible about myself when I even show the slightest bit of distance from him, he treats me as if I owe him sex. Never forces me to but will bring it up constantly, about how we haven’t and it’s just “makes him feel so bad and self conscious about himself” I don’t know what to do I told him I wanted to move back home and he went in behind me and unpacked my bags as I packed them.",1

"I did do a couple years of college but in the midst of it, I developed a physical disability (blood clots in the legs) and was forced to drop out. Naturally, this difficult transition wasn't made any easier when mom began calling me to claim I was faking being disabled because I'd seen the actually disabled people in/around my life, how easy they had it not having to work, and I just wanted to do that. For financial reasons, I haven't been able to return to college, but I genuinely want to if it ever becomes feasible. Last year, I finally found a decent therapist and started seeing her every other week. That has helped some, keeping my depression in check and teaching me techniques to rein in my anxiety.",0

Honestly, there was a lot of support and encouragement to seek treatment from people I talked to about it previously.

I understand theres vouchers and low income housing programs too, but was also informed these low income houses still require proof of an income to be sure that the tenant can pay rent and CS doesnt count as that income. I’m looking for any loopholes in the system or any programs in place that could help with this, if anyone has any information or insight that would be truly appreciated. Thanks Reddit! !",0
"Anyway, I just sort of got the news and don't even know if I'm posting this right. I don't even know what I'm ask for or how to do this. I feel embarrassed and vulnerable to everything right now. I'm sorry if any of this violates posting rules. I can give more information if needed in PM.",1
"It’s getting up above 100 here, and I’d like to have something I can easily carry in my car to give out since I’m working deliveries. Unfortunately I’ve been without a steady job for 6 months so I can’t do to much, but I was thinking about buying a bunch of plastic water bottles, freezing them, and carrying them in a cooler in my car to give out when I’m at lights. Would this be helpful? What other small or inexpensive things would help make the summer a bit more bearable?",1
"Tomorrow afternoon my four children and I are leaving my husband. After years of emotional neglected, financial control and recently added physical abuse towards my youngest. I'm scared that even after our planning we will be turned away from the refuge and have to use the little amount savings to rent a cabin. I'm scared that I'm making the wrong descion. Even though my 3 older children have developed mental illness over the past year.",1
But she then came out of the bathroom a second time and attached me saying she was going to fucking kill me and started choking me. I did push her back against bathroom door just to restrain her. Not to hit her Just to try to figure out what was going on. It was the 3rd time i was attacked in 24 hours. I was scared.,1
"The only issue maybe is that she's quite clingy, which I don't mind to a point, but I like my own time and space and that's something I've really began to miss since we moved in together. This stuff doesn't seem to bother her at all and even after spending entire weeks with me straight, she is often sad and upset when we have time apart. I'm starting to realise she loves me more than I love her. And when I think about marriage and children, I'm wondering whether she is the girl I want to do it all with. At the same time, I don't want to end things and then regret it and never get what we've had again.",0
I only realized this was a stupid idea in my freshman year of college when I started having flashbacks. I tried once more to do therapy and almost failed out of school. Again I buried it all to be dealt with at a more convenient time. I have now been working in a job that don't mind for the last year and 3 months. I found that November and December were a struggle and because of that I planned to address my stuff by going to therapy starting in 2019.,1
"I am just sick of this being my daily life. Between the derealization and the hypervigilance and paranoia even on good days I still don't feel like a person - and that's not even touching the flashbacks and nightmares. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't find a shrink who I trust or who seems equipped to help with the particular symptoms I have, and that seems like my only option. What do I do?",1
"We’ve been together for 4 years now, living together for just over 1. He’s a very sweet guy, but at times he can seem childish. He’s always joking or making fun. But he also seems very uninterested in things, and to brutally honest if you saw his resting face you would think he doesn’t care about anything. It’s so relaxed with heavy eyelids and he speaks in monotone quietly.",0
"Hey Reddit PTSD - I am an independent documentary filmmaker working on a series of shorts in Amsterdam about emotional memory disorders, including PTSD. I heard about your subreddit from my brother.

"At first, I could still do some short work but by 2015, it was a no go. I applied for SSI and SSDI in Dec, 2015. Denial after denial. I had a lawyer. Final hearing in front of the ALJ was April 3rd, 2018.",0
"I had a skin graft. It hurts, every day. Not all the time, but usually when I'm upset or having a hard time. It'd be nice to know the pain isn't all in my head and maybe it's actually a physical consequence. It just hurts.",1
"But I have been on about a dozen times, and have been hung up on nine. It is always the same issue, sadly. I get depressed, it is late, I cannot sleep or stop thinking about past trauma, and I would just like to talk to someone. But the bulk of them have hung up, some almost immediately, and some after longer. It is the longer ones that hurt more.",1
"I've been renting since university and I'm getting sick of seeing the same amount of money I'd pay towards a mortgage go into the pocket of someone else. I have a junior role in the company, it's going somewhere (I hope) but not fast. I find financially I'm staying basically cash-neutral and my quality of life isn't brilliant. I'm not managing to save anything. I've been thinking that I should get a house with the money I inherited.",0
"Bottom line is this is the first situation in a long while causing me to really get anxious. I'm thinking about it most of the time and waffling about it. And today I got the invitation and started looking into flights and transport and I'm overwhelmed. I'm at an age where traveling alone shouldn't be a big deal, but it is, I never have traveled alone aside from a handful of 2 hr bus trips in 2007ish. Any advice?",1
"So let’s say I like person b [16F] and recently went on a date with her. Person b [16F] tells me that my best friend is telling his girlfriend (who is person b’s best friend) everything that me, person c[16M] (our best friend as well), and other boyfriend discuss as a group of really tight friends. And I mean everything. Person b doesn’t want me to say anything, but should I confront other boyfriend, tell friend c, or just shrug it off? **TL;DR** Us three guys have been friends for three years now and met these girls about 6 months ago; what should I do?",0
">This put an end to his trips outside. He has now become a house cat, staying inside. Cats transfer FIV though deep bites from other cats with it, which means at least one of his siblings also has it. Ernie being FIV means that his body is not capable of fighting off diseases. He cannot go outside because if he gets sick his body will not be able to heal, so we keep him inside.",0
"Not because I didn’t have evidence, but because none of the evidence was permissible in court. My last order of protection was denied. I’m a survivor of childhood incest. It just seems like no one cares or wants to care about the psychological repercussions any of this abuse has on people. And I’m the one to blame for not being a perfectly normal person.",1
I got connected with the DV shelter in town to connect to my Crime Victim funds so I don't have to worry about therapy co-pays and I'm filled to the brim with anxiety about class tomorrow. I'm so tired of this. I hate that he probably witnessed me plunging into a panic attack. I hate that he saw that side of me. I don't want to look weak in front of him.,1
"- Lastly, it may be perceived to imply that having a positive mind frame will solve problems. As I understand it, this is not the message, only that there are methods to help overcome negative thinking of which this is one, but there are no guarantees. To be clear, this is not intended to be a 'cure', nor do I know if it applies to everyone, understanding is an important to recovery/reducing anxiety. and for me it helped. Beneath I will post what I discovered and how this has helped me.",0
"When I ask him why he’s done this he says “Shut the fuck up.” He also “talks down” to me in bed, calling me slut, pig, and stupid. I am NOT into this and I never told him I was. When I am giving him fellatio he pushes my head down even when I am resisting and I choke. He has also pulled my hair, hit me and punched me.",1
"I have panic attack after panic attack and I truly just don't know what to do anymore. No matter how I explain the severity of my situation to people, they STILL somehow seem to not understand just how miserable my mind makes me everyday. I get intrusive thoughts like about how something terrible could happen to my family, or a lot of ""what ifs"". My mind is running 24/7 and it's driving me insane. I have a terrible fear of dying along with an even more crippling fear of something happening to my family (my parents, brothers..) all day long my mind plays thoughts and scenarios that leave me sad, scared, constantly wired with fear, and over all exhausted.",1
I’m not living a lavish lifestyle or rolling around in money. I explained to her that if we divided rent based on income percentage she would actually be paying more per month. All this on top of the fact that she turned down a free car. It feels really unfair because I think she blames me for moving us to a “more expensive” location for my new job. So in her mind she shouldn’t have to pay anything more than the dirt-cheap rent I was charging her to live with me at my house.,0
"You can watch the video before you leave! Funny, I never did get to see that video. Neither did anyone else. Call me Cass. What I didn't see coming: my caseworker got pissed that I missed a meeting and didn't bother getting me a bus pass.",0
"As the years went by the town labelled them as high school sweethearts, and every teenager envied their relationship. Everywhere she went, he followed. Every sport he played, she cheered. Through rain, sleet, snow, and sunshine she was in the stands proudly cheering him on. In their own little world they were in love.",0
It honestly felt like someone punched a hole right through me. Later in the day I texted her and we talked. I asked her how the trip went. She sounded exited to talk to me and it sounded like it would work out between us. I asked her abut her friend and if anything had happened between them and she said that nothing had happened and that her aunt was with her the whole time.,1

"Then he didn't talk  to me for day and after that suddenly he pretends like nothing ever happened. He also tries to tell me that I remember things wrong in these fights, and that I am the one who always starts them. Last night this happened again, until he said some things that I don't feel are possible to take back, like telling me I am a loser and all of my friends hate me because I'm an a#$hole, and that he regretted bringing me up. I feel that crossed a line, due to the fact that this argument started because he told me when I was barbecuing sausages not to put the lid down, even though that's the way I always do it. He then proceeds to tell me my memories of cooking sausages have never happened, and then starts the fight/argument.",1

"Since then, I've been having major anxiety about my voice and have refused to speak to anyone because I am afraid that they will think I am a lying robot. If I sound this way when I'm feeling energetic and confident, how must I sound the rest of the time??? However, I know that I am going to have to speak again eventually because not only do I have a job interview AND a party on Tuesday BUT I also have to do most of the speaking for my boyfriend as he is not confident at all in his English. Have any of you ever been told you sound like a robot? How did you overcome it or how did you stop feeling anxious about this?",1

"He keeps saying he hates himself for this and won't let it happen again. I know he has a really big heart, so I don't know what to do. Is our relationship worth it?

"I am frantically trying to figure out what distractions I can rely on during down-time. The group I will be with are ecstatic about the cruise, and have no issue with sitting in a recliner and doing nothing. I, however, don't want to be alone with my thoughts. I plan on bringing books, audio books, podcasts, and whatever videos I can cram on my device(s), but reading or listening to something during an activity or around the group will probably be seen as rude or anti-social. The wifi on the ship is supposedly terrible and expensive, so I can't even casually browse reddit - which is normally my go-to distraction.",1
"I met Zach and James. We were roughly the same age. James was a top-notcher, consistent honour student ever since 1st grade, and had a younger sister who was in 2nd grade at the time. However, Zach wasn't that smart, he was average, yet very decent and very cool. Fast forward to our first quarter test, after finishing all my exams during the day, James asked me, out of the blue, ""Saan mo mas gusto?",0
"Sometimes I'll stop and just stand somewhere or stare until I get snapped out of it. I don't know for how long but it can't be for more than 10 minutes. I just found out about catatonia and I show a few other symptoms. When I dissociate it's usually a lot more violent and delusional so I thought maybe it was something else. I haven't brought it up with my therapist because I just had a meeting with her before learning about this, am I just looking too deep into things?",1
"When I was eighteen I lived with my father as adult roomates, I found him four years later at 22, when he died of a heroin overdose. He was bereft at the fact that he had done wrong by us kids during those years. He had striven to be better than his father, who was a overtly cruel man who abandoned the family when he was 11. It is so hard for me to think he knew any better. The only way he could have done right by us, would have been to give us kids up.",0
"Being in there was hell, I cried most of the first few days. I was very disoriented, couldn't sleep, the windows had metal grates over them. The bathrooms were locked and you had to ask for permission to use the toilets. While I was waiting to use the toilet the nurse came in my room and grabbed the door out of my hands forcefully and I didn't let go (I think its my right to use the bathroom when I need to). She then came back with a bunch of men and they held me down to the bed, pulled down my pants and gave me a shot in the butt of some sedative.",1
"I decided to park behind it to see what their business was. They called 911 on me. I saw the copper stoppers coming and decided to pull in to my driveway, unload my kids and go inside while they dealt with the strange people. Well, the were there to deal with me! And one was walking up to question me while the other followed my children into my house!",1
"You would try to understand (not to be confused with accept) their perspective and make a deal that will satisfy them and you. In the same way you would negotiate with your client.

"I'm looking for some encouragement to get through a phase where I currently just want everything to be over. Im so tired of thinking about things over and over.

People who have gone through this phase what did you do to get through it.",1
"I got out of an abusive relationship about three years ago. I had awful things happen to me before it, but it really was the absolute rock bottom. The man strangled me unconscious and beat me, and I wound up sleeping with a knife under my pillow, and then sleeping on the streets, constantly checking over my shoulder. But I got inpatient therapy and a network of supportive friends and I was all clear, and no contact with the guy whatsoever. I had a couple of nice flings, but after that I guess what I did was work on being alone and happy with it.",0
"They were late. They tried to play it cool with the excuse they gave, but J had this grin on his face and Lux had the flushes look she gets when she has sex. And then Lux said she was going to fix her hair and left to the bathroom and after a while J said he was going to see if she needed help. Obviously they left to have sex. I mean, fine, but I thought that was a bit disrespectful.",0
"Today was a horrible day from the get go and I had to call out because I cant function with other people (I work in retail) today so I claimed I had a fever. Of course it had to be memorial day weekend making it one of the worst times for this and they even of course said over the phone ""Well, this really puts us in a bind"". Now I'm absolutely paranoid that they'll find out or they hate me now or I'll get fired for this. I'm so paranoid I'm worried they'll see me or come to my house to check on me even though I know they would never do that. I just wish someone could understand or sympathize/empathize with me for once.",1
"For my two worst offenders, they will each get a postcard. Everyone at work will read that post card as it gets passed to the executive director of the rehab center. The old lady will get a warning that she's not smart enough to protect herself and she should be thankful she picked on another elderly widow woman instead of someone looking for revenge for fun. Over the years I've been to the mayor, I've attended a number of (laughable) ""homeless conferences"". It's all a joke so no approaching from that angle.",0
"The news is always problematic for folks with PTSD, but it just feels so much worse lately. I am not one to regularly get triggered by the news, but this weekend just was too much. I just felt like I was swept into this gigantic downward spiral. I really want to go clean up my room and get some food ready for tomorrow (the work week) (AKA do some ""adulating"") but I am so exasperated, exhausted, and burnt out that I just can't. And that is going to make the week even worse.",1
"I can't afford one of the really nice ones that actually looks more like real hair and not shiny plastic.

I really miss having nice hair. Thanks.",0
"I instantly thought of something I rarely think about, being molested in a pool locker room when I was 10. My heart started beating incredibly fast as I readied myself to tell them the thing I couldn’t even tell my family at the time. I started crying, something I haven’t done in years and something my friends have never seen me do. When it got to me, with my hand over my eyes all I could say was “I don’t think I can”. It felt like I was reliving what I’d gone through, like I could see it happening in front of me.",1

"how is it possible that he can drive and use his fist to punch you? did you do something wrong?"". The only thing I got from the police was a worn out looking card to the social work department (and by the way they offer counselling - nothing else). To this day, they have not arrested him because apparently the attack occurred in the middle of two districts (apparently it's really hard to determine which district is responsible) and because of bureaucratic issues, the man has not been taken to questioning. My mother helped me tremendously by arranging the divorce for me, and in the divorce, we did not put any alimony.",1
"I live in a high end building and I feel if I were to talk to the people who work in the office they wouldn’t take my name off the lease, that they wouldn’t care. I have told a couples therapist and my individual therapist the things he has done in the past, and what he says to me and his actions. I believe they would vouch for me. I also think if I were to say to the office people that I would like to leave before a real scene is made (cops being called, screaming, damage, etc) that they will be more inclined to take my name off lease. Thoughts?",1
"My flaws seemed huge to me, and I assumed everyone thought negatively of me all the time. My life was consumed by a spiral of negative thoughts and social anxiety. I went to my doc, admitted my social anxiety, and he prescribed me Lexapro 10mg/day. I took my first pill a few days ago, and not two hours later, I had nearly complete relief of my anxiety of all kinds. The bad thoughts completely stopped.",0
I typically would not care in the slightest about things like that but I feel as if since my good friends basically turned their backs on me that I am at a loss?

I told everyone they were amazing people. For the past two decades I have fought my body.",0
It does eventually pass once i realise they are sticking by me. Some just cant stick it out which is fair enough. I find it frustrating though as i have just drove someone away who i really liked. He has ended up deleting and blocking me as he didnt at all help with reassurance which just made my mind go into overdrive creating scenarios that were probably non existent. Does anybody else deal with this?,0
"All these sexual abuse accusations, while wonderful to see so many men and women coming forward about sexual abuse, I just can't escape it. So much victim blaming, the increasingly clear proof that many men do not actually understand what consent means, it's just too much. I haven't left the apartment in days and the only reliable form of self medication is too expensive (weed). I'm also autistic so I've noticed it's also overstimulating me to the point I'm hiding. It's just too much and I thank you for reading my vent.",1

Even if they have a sign up that they are hiring, they tell me ""sorry we're not hiring right now.""",1
Obviously this doesn’t help the mental health. I have a great relationship with a professor at my institution. Because I go to a SLAC close professor / student relationships are encouraged. My professor has been very helpful and making sure I get the mental health assistance needed while at school while also frequently checking in on me. This person has also offered to Skype me over break if I needed to chat or if being home became difficult.,0

Now in April of this year I got a call from my attorney from the protection order case. My ex's attorney had contacted her to ask why I hadn't dismissed the case like I'd offered originally.

"But I told him that I’m not over it and his response was kinda like “ I feel so guilty, it makes my life hard, I wish you could just forgive me.” So now I feel pressured to forgive him and it’s frustrating because he didn’t give a damn about my feelings when I was 9 and crying my eyes out because I just saw my dad push mom and hit her. In fact, I remember him telling me to shut up. He didn’t give a damn about my brother when he pushed him against a wall to yell at him when he was only in middle school. And I can’t help but feel like that fueled my brothers heroin addiction that almost killed him and still could cause he recently relapsed. I’m just so angry and I don’t want to be.",1

"He says he doesn’t remember this happening. But he has a short fuse as it is. He’s temperamental, out of work, depressed, has a family history of substance abuse, and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2.

The conversations aren't stilted, and there isn't one sidedness, but it's just that there's a lot of it Right now i'm ignoring her for periods of 15 minutes or so, but I feel bad.

Basically he makes too much money for help has no other family or friends to help I can barely help myself let alone my dad and his two dogs...but he has literally no where to go and he's gonna be homeless by the time he gets put of his house which he is being evicted from. His credit is too low to get a place and now with this eviction it will be harder. Also he lives on a fixed income which isn't to bad but it's still not gonna be enough to move in a month considering his credit history. I don't want my dad to be homeless....what can he do? Sorry if this doesn't apply to this group...idk what else to do...,1
"This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid. I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date. I'm just really happy and gay and proud of myself and Stephanie is really cute that is all",0
"I had no good friends in my class, I never had a partner when it was time to pair up on our own, the work was going to get harder and we would be working on clients soon.

But everyone asked what was I gonna do next, why did I drop out.",1
"I am ignoring him, that's not what this post is about. Basically, after all this time my ex has recently, decided he ""knows"" I cheated on him our entire relationship [I didn't], ""knows"" I'm this chick online who post XXX pictures of herself [I'm not] and has ""reminded"" me of incidences of our relationship that has literally never happened. Like, for one example *""...that time I called you from jail, and you cried b/c you were at a guys house and you knew what you did was wrong so you told me you needed help...""* yet he won't show me any evidence (it doesn't exist)... He's literally fabricating things out of thin air and claiming they happened. He isn't denying that he was an abuser, but he's saying like ""You were bad too!",1

"Also, to answer the million dollar question everyone has, ""How does this happen to someone who outearns her abuser by a factor of 6?"" I wish people talked more about the other side of financial abuse. We hear all about the men who financially abuse their partners by prohibiting them from having a job, or denying them access to bank accounts, and that sort of thing. There's also the side where they monitor every account and become completely terrifying if their higher earning partner so much as buys one cup of coffee that they didn't approve of.

I have it for 7.5mg twice a day. I also took Trazadone one night and felt similar effects from the Klonopin. Does Buspar have much in terms of withdrawal?

I'm not usually clingy but we used to talk on the phone several times a day. this turned into a 5 minute call.",1
I literally felt her lose interest in talking to me as I said that. She asked me some basic questions and then suggested that I go into walk-in counseling that my school offers because she doesn't want to waste MY time being there. I told her that it wasnt a waste of my time and that I'm here because I want to get better. This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide. She acknowledged the fact that I wanted to stay and talk about other things in therapy but she proceeding to rush me out.,1

"Things can happen during the course of life that are all quite normal, then something happens to change our perceptions and suddenly we can remember something that previously appeared innocuous to us, but with our new found perspective, we can feel guilty about it. And we can feel guilty about things we have done, we can feel guilty about things we didn't do, but wish we had, and of course we can feel guilty for nothing at all. We don't have to have done something or omitted to do something in order to feel guilty. Others can make us feel guilty through their expectations of us. Expectations can lead to disappointment, and their feeling of disappointment can lead to our feeling of guilt.",0

"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

I waited a bit and then went and talked to our advisor. I vaguely and briefly explained what happened so I could get his help in understanding some procedures I didn't understand. We went down to the lab and figured out my work together. I was then standing and doing something with my samples while my advisor was doing something else in the room. Then I suddenly looked up toward the door and entirely expected my fellow student to burst in yelling about how I told our advisor.,0

"I always sound like I’m about to cry. I get really hot and sweaty, my hearing starts to go. I had to stop in a presentation one time last semester to say “I’m sorry if I have pretty bad anxiety so if it looks like I’m about to pass out, please catch me” which was to keep it light and the class did laugh, but it was also a legitimate concern. Does anyone else experience this? Is this what social anxiety is?",1
"He admitted to me that night that yes, she needs mental assistance. But after spending the morning with her, he thinks that it's better to have me in the house at all. This situation was over the top and heartbreaking that my parents would rather not work with a therapist (i've even suggest family therapy) and just decide to ban me from the house. I understand that isolating myself from them is the best option and I know it will be hard. But I do love my family, and I would rather not have to make this decision.",0
"I've never done this before but we always stay at my house, so maybe the odds are just greater here? After she told me about it in the morning I feel like pure shit.

"Also, you’re incredibly ditzy and that gives off the idea that you’re stupid.” Last week, she rudely corrected me in front of a patient and then rolled her eyes and shook her head. The patient leaned into me and said, “What the heck was that about?” I finally got fed up and went to my boss. This coworker is very manipulative and loves to gaslight me.

I heard from a mutual friend that she got engaged and I’m truly happy for her and would like to wish her congratulations. I don’t need forgiveness I would just like to move on I guess? Is it is selfish of me to apologize to her and say congrats or just wish her congrats? should I just let it go and learn from my immaturity?

"I've applied to many other places over the months and using services like Indeed and Monster. But no such luck as of yet. The whole issue has left me feeling angry. When I talked to my therapist about it, he did help; however, the conversation had the tone of ""being a man"" and doing what you need to do and after a while to simply let go of the anger. I'm not trying to disregard him, but I've been having a hard time understanding what he means.",1
"And I’m scared all the time. I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories. And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating. I’m sorry. I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying.",1
"He laughed a loudly with a couple of people, but to my surprise, many of the others stayed silent. “I have faith young fool, I’m going to heaven, John 3:16 for God so loved the worl-” “I know, but Jesus said what is our faith without good works?” More awkward silence, while he still stood close to my face, so I turned away. I found out much later that he was kicked out of the food place for being disrespectful to a pastor that came to preach.",0
Could we all at least help out by chipping in at least a dollar for this van? Could we please give this family a break by helping and donating for this van!? These boys and her need it so much!! It would be worth every penny to be able to go on more play dates with her two boys and make their little live’s more adventurous. It would open up a door to giving them easier and more convenience access to fun spontaneous trips to go play and have fun.,0
"An interesting fact I once heard was that some people die out in the desert with water still in the bottle. These people would try and conserve their water supply but would end up dehydrating themselves in the process, laughable over a few shots of whiskey but an important note at that. I  drink nearly all I have and only saving a little to keep the mouth moist after a smoke and I find that by doing so I stay hydrated, never feeling like crap because the water hadn’t finished absorbing into my system.

"When first diagnosed I was put on a daily prozac. 3 years later, I've managed to wean myself off and just use my klonopin only for the worst attacks. That actually seemed to work well and I've been off the prozac for about a year and even got off Facebook 3 months ago because it was becoming a point of unneeded drama, but I'm suddenly getting the depression symptoms again. I've walled myself off from most people and have become less communicative with my husband. I don't like going to our neighbors house because I have a paranoia that 2 of them don't like me.",1
"She still invites me to things and hasn't started dating anyone else (or even talked about it), but frankly, I'm starting to feel kind of pathetic asking her to hang out after she turned me down for the date. I do like her as a friend, but have started thinking of her as more than that and it's hard for me to ignore that when we spend time together. It's even starting to affect my self-esteem a bit, because usually if someone turns me down (no matter how reasonable the excuse) I just move on to someone else and spend less time with them, but it's a bit harder when that person is already your friend. My questions are: should I just give up on the potential of a romantic future with this person, or is it possible she's still feeling things out (like she says)? And regardless of this, should I start spending less time with her/stop inviting her to things (even if just for my own sake)?",1
"Things with my foster parents were reaching a breaking point, so I finally ran away from home. I've never gone back, and never will go back. I'd rather die than go back into a cage.

I still had my job, so I was just relaxing and enjoying my newfound freedom.",0

My uncle is nice enough to let me rent out one of his places, but after rent, and utilities, and gas to get to work, I don’t have anything left over.

He even stopped eating food that my mom makes and starting making his own for himself. Yesterday I atleast bought my mom a new cell phone and added her to my plan. He hasn't improved in the past week whatsoever. This was the last straw for me and I want to move out in the next 2 months and ask her to live with me temporarily.",1

"For instance, there was a show on netflix that I thought would be fun to watch together, but she said she couldn't because she used to watch it with her ex and it reminds her of him. Like, are you even over him? She constantly compares me to her ex's in subtle (maybe not subtle) ways, like ""[ex] used to do this thing you do, and you know how I feel about that."" I'm not your ex, I don't think it's fair of you to compare me to him like that all the time. She says she's ""not used to being single,"" it kind of makes me feel like she's using me to get reassurance and validation.",1
"I don't have the ability to cope with it anymore. I'm trying, but a lot of things are triggering me, and I'm shutting down at work, just finding the place I feel safest, and staying there for an hour or two until I feel like I can do something again. I'm tired of watching my back, tired of traveling to places I don't feel safe, tired of reliving that moment, tired of being triggered, tired of the stress, tired of anxiety and knots in my stomach, tired of irrational thought when triggered, tired of irrational paranoia. I'm exhausted and need a break, but know it won't be enough until I journey the long road through therapy. I'm not suicidal at all, just wishing this pain and misery would end, to have my life back again.",1
My mother has stage 4 bile duct cancer and it seems like her time is limited. She has a $5k insurance policy but I know that's not going to be enough.

"However, over the next day she changed her mind and is now convinced that she has given us enough chances, that nothing would change (in terms of me and my issues) if we tried again. The kicker is that she still loves me, she’s still attracted to me (we got onto normal conversation, joked around as usual, even had sex twice in the last couple of days), she comforted me as I bawled about her leaving. We’ve been texting a fair bit since she went, some normal and some more serious conversation.

He doesn’t seem keen on the idea of doing anything else. I guess I’m just looking for some perspective. After having this big talk we both expressed that we really, really don’t want to break up. Then I begin thinking, if I’m unwilling to move back to DC, and he’s willing to place this notion of an ideal career ahead of me, do we really love each other that much?",0
I have been trying to find an answer to this question over 6 months. My story starts when I changed while my life for the man I loved by believing him that he loves me and moving to California from Israel. Since I was the one who were going to take the big step I had many concerns yet he always literally begged me to move here... finally I did move here and we got married. After a while I found out from a Facebook message that he has been cheating on me all those time that he was begging me to move in with him. I asked him about the message and he lied about it over an hour.,1

"So, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, I'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this. Lots of things happened, too many to list in a single post, but it got much worse last year when my daughter was molested by my younger brother. We had asked my parents to watch my two daughters due to a medical emergency, and that's when it happened, with my father in the room, his eyes glued to his cell phone. We involved CPS, the police, but my daughter didn't quite tell the police everything, and with their investigation, they could not press charges against him. After their investigation was complete, we informed my parents of what happened, and they called my then 5 year old daughter a liar to her face.",1

I don’t feel like me anymore and I just feel scared all the time now over every little thing. I don’t have money to see a therapist either...,1
"I guess 15 years later and I haven't put being bullied in high school behind me. Probably doesnt help that I'm unsecured about my body and feel that everyone is judging me because I'm a personal trainer lol... *sigh* . i look fine, just not up to par with more serious gym dwellers. And work performance? Well personal training is a sales gig.",0
He’s claiming I beat him in that fight. I had to go to court and be treated like I was the abuser and the whole time he sat there next to me. A protection order was written and I nor my daughter can go home. I have a 30 day to vacate of face eviction from my landlord and I lost my job over all of this. My pre trial is next month and my lawyer seems like he has no idea about my case.,1
"I brought it up to him (assuming this forum would tell me to) and he got very livid at me. Now we’re not speaking (His friend is still at his house). Not sure what to do. TL;DR: bfs friend from out of town is staying with him while I was away. Not sure if they are doing normal friend stuff, or if my bf has a crush.",1
"! I feel like I am in a pit that I cannot escape from. I know that I am anxious all the time and terrified of fucking up and I know for sure that the more anxious I am, the more I cannot focus well and think straight and the more likely it is for me to fuck up .. and somehow, everytime I do, I feel like I just want to belittle myself so much that I deliberately and purposefully want to see myself covered in blood and bruises because I feel like I deserve it! ! EDIT 2 ..",1
"When I grew up, my parents were always working and were never home, didn't express interest in spending time with their children. I was alone all the time and it made me depressed. I wasn't able to make many friends because my parents never drove me to see people. I did parental duties for my siblings. I made my sister meals when she was 7 years old losing weight because my parents never cooked for her.",0
"But it's been 2 monthsalready this time. We didn't speak for Christmas or new year. I'm lonely, sad, angry at the situation (not angry at him!) and the worst part is not being able to talk or even know what's going on. We didn't fight before this so he's not angry at me.",1
And I don't even remember. Please help me. He says it's ok and he forgives me. But it's NOT OKAY. my diagnoses and the symptoms of it is never an excuse to hurt the ones I love.,1
* I refused to fold his underwear. Just a couple smacks this time. (age 9) * I couldn't convince my dad to sign adoption papers so stepdad could adopt me. Late nights with mom ensue and I get special attention from stepdad for a week or two (age 7 or 8),0
"Then about 25 minutes later I got a message from her saying that she was downstairs with Annie and her friends pre-drinking so I came down. I asked her how long she was down for and she said the whole time as Annie was already downstairs. I asked her why she didn't let me know everyone was downstairs already, instead of just leaving me in my room by myself to which she replied ""don't worry about it, it's no big deal."" I said it seemed weird she just din't think to tell me for nearly half an hour to which she rolled her eyes and said ""oh don't you start."" I decided it wasn't worth getting annoyed about it and didn't bring it up again.",0
Nothing He kicked the door 18-36-30 He kicked it again and until he was sure his foot would bruise Calm down,1
"He has since gained back about three pounds, but he is still a far shot from what he used to be. He's going into the procedure tomorrow. The total cost is 1150 dollars, and to be honest, I'm a poor college student. The procedure will be put on a credit card, and I probably won't be paying it off for a long time. Blackie has been my cat for the last ten years, and without this treatment there is a good chance he will not make it past summer.",1
"Snot. Slobber. Just uncontrollable sadness. I was about to explain to her that we would be back later that night and if she was good, we'd bring her a treat. But Mom just scooped her up and coddled her like you would a 9 month old who was crying because they were a bit cranky.",0
"He has made me eat until I literally threw up, then forced me to eat my vomit. He plays mental games that are pure torture. He knows how to break me down mentally until I just become ruined for a period of time. He will point guns at me. He made me play Russian Roulette (turns out the gun wasn't loaded but he used a hand trick to make it appear loaded.",1
"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.",0
"Every morning I wake up and it's there on the exact same spot. This has been happening for the past 4 days and I thought I need to reach out to someone if they can help me at all? I have convinced myself I have a brain tumour, I keep feeling dissociated and completely out of it I keep touching the same spot on my head like every 20 seconds like a compulsion and it's really getting me down. When I swallow i feel as if i can feel a pulling sensation near the spot where this is happening. It's not exactly giving me a headache but it's disturbing me to which i notice it.",1
"I want to be able to deal with these feelings and move on. I’ve talked briefly to a counsellor on the phone but besides talking about it making me cry, it hasn’t made me feel better. This is one of the worst PTSD episodes of my life. I can’t predict how long this is going to go on and I’m sick of the weak, dissolving feeling I get whenever I think about it. I’ve been trying to replace bad thoughts with good, I’ve tried CBT techniques, I’ve tried wallowing in the bad thoughts (as advised by someone over at r/emetophobia)... nothing has worked, I’m a mess.",1
Obviously they don't care but to me it means everything. I've always been like this. My dream one day is just to magically wake up with this skill.. if only like worked like that.. Does anyone have any tips on how to calm my anxiety down and not let it overpower me? Anything would be greatly appreciated.,1
"**While at a shelter** Depending on the nature of the shelter, you may be asked to follow specific security rules designed to protect you, other residents, and the shelter staff. Although those rules may sometimes seem a little bit restrictive, it’s important to follow them for everyone’s safety. If the abusive partner had access to your cell phone or your account, you may be asked to remove your phone’s battery, and maybe even wrap it in tinfoil to block any transmissions. Although this may sound a little bit extreme, this might be done because a cell phone may be used to track you or find out where you’re going.",0
"Don't have a bus pass or anything unfortunately. The question is...where? I haven't seen any homeless shelters near me, much less ones for women. I currently have no job. Nothing.",1
"Except now, the boyfriend's taken up drinking as he did before and has fallen back into his verbal and physically abusive habits. I'm not willing to take this anymore and I honestly fear for my safety when he has these psychotic mood swings. I have nowhere to go, though. No family or friends in this area and honestly, the area my family does live in was a ""living with druggies"" situation I do not want to be forced back into. I don't know what to do.",1
"But what do I know? I keep reassuring myself that this is normal, and never tell anyone about this - I'm surprising one of the top students at a selective high school, but I really want this to end. I'm good at hiding things like this, because I don't want others feeling pity for me for things they didn't cause or can change.   ---   **tl;dr**: Older brother psychologically and physically abuses me and my younger brother.",1
"There became two sides of me I battled within myself. On one hand, I wanted us to build a life together, to experience that love and the relationship. I did most days. On the other, I wanted to absolve myself. I obsessed with it.",1
"I have been seeing mia for about 3-4 months Last night we were together drinking at a little get together before going to the club about 7-8 people in a small group, everyone knows each other pretty well. Mia was drunk and being quite obnoxious which can be fun just as much as it can be bad? She started talking about how her girl friends all get nice things from their boyfriends, a $500 hair job, presents/gifts whatever Made me feel a bit uncomfortable because it was clearly something targeted at me and she was saying this in front of everyone",0
"A emotional turning point for me was at 16, my dog at the time, a Lovable and super friendly Labrador who was about 3 years, decided to wander out the gate and explore when he drove in after work one evening. It was a freezing cold night i remember. Ge had tried calling for our Lab to no avail as our lab was exploring down the road. My father (i hate saying that!) Started getting very angry, furious even.",1
"I know this may seem like a small thing, but to someone with these problems, it's a huge deal and to be at a store where you do not feel ""safe"" around your managers and you can't talk with them and grow as an employee, what's the point of continuing to work there? So I luckily got them to put me on 3rd shift. Minimal contact and I still get to work for the company. As I did mention, I have been struggling lately with some things: being slow with completing tasks on the work list is the biggest issue I believe. I'm not sure why I'm slow, in the past a supervisor has said ""Yes you're slow, but you're thorough.""",1
"So, a long time ago when I was in around the 2nd or 3rd grade, I went out to a diner with my family for breakfast and when we went to go pay I saw these two girls in my class. So, they asked me if I wanted to come over and my mom said yes so I went to one of the girl's house for a playdate. So, I went over there and they told me that in order for me to be friends with them I would have to do this initiation thing. Apparently it's a thing they do with another girl in our class. And it was to take off all of our clothes and play pretend.",0
"It sucks. I know I need help. I want to get help. I was sexually abused throughout my childhood (at least 10 years, possibly longer). I forgot the memories for a long time but now I'm finally getting them back and it's freaking me out.",1
"I need quiet and darkness to recover from a major trigger like that. I went inside and sat in the bathroom with the lights off. We had left the radio on in the bedroom and it was blaring so loudly, but I couldn't move I just needed to sit for a little bit. I thought I had calmed myself back down so I went into our office. He came into the office all furious.",1
"That could be defeated by National Post printing a rebuttal, strongly worded and well researched (the antithesis of the illiterate vendetta piece Cosh wrote and Owens supported) explaining the science behind PTSD Service dogs: science that has been peer reviewed and minutely studied since 2002. But sadly, as of now the National Post refuses to stand by the oath of all journalists that speaks to integrity and education. &nbsp; >Brian here: If a politician said something this stupid, they’d be sent for a sensitivity class and left off the nomination papers next election. A team player would be fined.",0
"Hi there r/Assistance! My dad has a Traumatic Brain Injury from a car accident two years ago. He was the victim of another driver's recklessness and negligence, and was rear-ended twice while stopped at a stoplight. He was forced to retire as he is now permanently disabled and will have to deal with the effects of permanent brain damage for the rest of his life. My dad requires a constant caretaker because he exhibits symptoms similar to that of an alzheimer's or dementia patient, so my mom is unable to work either.",0
"I've been in therapy (and will go back soon now) but I've never had to practice harm reduction around self harm--I need practical advice. I know that because I've never felt so out of control than last night when I was hitting myself. TL;DR I got drunk last night, destroyed my room, and hit myself on the head hard enough to give myself welts for the first time in my adult life. I need advice on not doing this self harm crap.",1
"-I don't have any relief in my symptoms and am concerned that I've wasted an entire year of my life I'm concerned that I not leave this relationship too soon, but at the same time, I'm paying for this therapy, I have repeatedly brought up questions about goals in my sessions, and don't feel like this is the right fit...unless I need to open up more. I chose her initially because she was covered by my insurance less because I felt like she was the right match. Do I stick this out? I have started to fantasize about having a new therapist, because then I could start over and feel heard.",1
I'm assuming I have PTSD and my work gave me a number to call and I'm debating doing so. But I hate asking for help and I feel pathetic because nothing happened. I'm physically fine. I just really need advice because I'm struggling on how to feel. I don't know why I can't just brush this off considering I'm alright.,1
"But now it seems like contact is gonna be forced on me. About two weeks after the breakup, she reached out to tell me she'd gotten an interview at my company. We both work in a pretty specific industry and there was always some overlap with our jobs. Apparently, my company wants to put her company out of business. Recruiters have poached a few folks from her work and I guess she was next on the list.",1
"bah. Anyway, couple months down the line, I met her family, loved them, they loved me (they're first impression of me was, get this, me clogging they're toileting and it overflowing with me yelling SOS through the bathroom door.. it was awesome lol). L and I continued to grow even closer as my now senior year progressed (her junior). Then March happened. L started to act wierd.",0
"In some ways, I can handle it more than the average person who hasn't gone though such a trauma. Sometimes it's hard to remember that, though, when you're breaking down over some otherwise harmless feedback. I'm tired of people misunderstanding. I'm tired of feeling weak and broken. I'm just tired.",1
"At least 20 Ritalin 30mg maybe more (I've learned how to take many at once over the years of daily medication). I don't remember everything but i tried to lie to him and he had to drag me to the bathroom and tried to make me throw up. After a bit i realized what i was doing and tried myself. It didn't work. The scary thing is that when he went to call the ambulance and i thought i just might die i repeated to myself ""It's finally over"".",1
"I get flashbacks from ptsd at home, and now my home is full of these spider and insect memories. And I feel like so few people in my life can really handle this and that’s even more isolating. I’m sorry. I needed a place to put this down and try and stop crying. I know my thoughts are disorganized right now and I’m finding it hard to organize them.",1
"He speeds up and tries to catch up to her, and continues to yell at her face. The girl turns around in pushes him out of frustration and can tell it wasn't meant to hurt him or anything. The guy reciprocates by immediately pushing her multiple times, and they were NOT soft pushes, and seems like he was trying to push her to the ground. Couple pushes in, I was in shock, by the fact that you could really be in a relationship with someone that is abusive or that physically hurts you, or maybe it was that moment, she found out who he really was. She got up immediately and walked the opposite direction, walking back towards me, and I try not to look at her but she was just devastated I can tell.",0
"Without my meds I can be kinda unstable, few months back I stopped taking them and ended up breaking my hand because of it. I have no real education except high school diploma and I wasn't smart enough to finish community college as I'm useless with math and science and that's all I needed to finish for a general studies degree. All I seem to be doing is existing and that means I'm a burden on anyone who tries to help me and right now I'm dragging my partner down. I just need help figuring out what to do so I can stop being burdensome and be useful and have a purpose again. I don't really know what to do anymore, but this is all I have left to try.",1
"The rare times we have fought in the past, I’ve always had to be the one to ‘break the ice,’ regardless of the circumstances of the argument. I don’t have it in me to go grovel for the comfort I sorely need. Now I’m just trying to cry myself asleep. What’s the point of having a partner if they can’t offer the most basic level of emotional support? Is the writing on the wall - is he just too immature, and how did this parent/child dynamic creep in to our relationship?",1
"Thanks in advance! Edit: You guys are the best. I now have a more solid footing on what to do and how to plan for it. Thank you so much. Any other advice is welcome, and thank you to everyone who took the time to say something.",0
"I was on a tear. I was dressing better, eating better, losing weight, dating a little, saving some money, I was on my way out of this pit. Now nothing seems to matter. Everyone else is so far ahead of me. I finally felt like I was making up ground and the people around me did too, so they took off the kid gloves they'd been using around me a little bit and sharing more of their lives and I am realizing how completely inadequate I am compared to them and how far behind I really am in life.",0
"I am scared as fuck off what the comedown is going to be like from being jacked up on adrenaline for 5 days straight. I have not felt tired whatsoever during this time. I have been giving valium and trazadone to sleep, by an emerg psyciatrist, of which I cannot feel either whatsoever. On top of that when I do this twitch many times in a row, i can actually see and feel my entire veins/circulatory system constricting down very small. they have been in a state of permenant constriction for 4 days now.",1
"*Major trigger warning* I find comfort in confined spaces, and can spend prolonged time in confined spaces verycomfortably. This is odd to most people, but I’ll explain why. When I was with my parents, they were super abusive. They forced me to watch animals die, and frequently changed around my room so I wasn’t familiar with it. They forcefully put splinters in my feet, allowed men to sexually assault me, and they even pepper sprayed me a couple times as a 2 year old.",1
. . . I had an emotionally and physically abusive mother growing up and and an absent drunk father. At 13 I was convinced by a 30-something year old man I was his girlfriend and introduced to drugs.,1
"I wrote a 4000-word short story on depression to bring awareness. I need around 10-15 people to answer the questionnaire. If you guys could answer it, show it to maybe somebody or tell me somehwhere I could post it to get more people to read and answer, that would be so great. <url> (This is the questionnaire, and a link to the story can be found inside)",0
"This is my first post here, and I wanted to contribute something that has helped me with dealing with my anxiety recently. Maybe it will help you, too. [Success and Failure Don't Change Who You <url> In short, a success or failure does not define who YOU are. You are still the same person that you were before you were faced with whatever adversity came your way, and win or lose, you are that same person in the end.",0
"we had few arguements, then i stopped interacting with him. I myself did feel that i was in the 'teenage phase where you start having problems with your dad. I, according to him, was being irrational, rash, non-docile, difficult, nothing like he had seen before, haughty etc. He even slapped me ( his 23 , well i turned 24 this week, year old daughter), and then during the heat of moments he has , not just once said, that he wants me to go away, that he doesnt want to have to do anything with me, and he doesnt care where i go , what i do. So right now, yes i have decided to go somewhere, somewhere far, somewhere obscure , as somebody or rather nobody, start a  new life, start with nothing.",1
It makes sense to see danger around every corner. But I wish I could find a place where it isn't so dark. I read a story the other day about someone who couldn't work anymore and just needed to be at home. . .,1
"How should I feel after all this? Because I feel like I was used and treated poorly, which she rejects. Also how should I read into her getting annoyed about me being with other girls? If they break up again (this is their 3rd attempt at making their relationship work), should I be there in the same way ago? As much as I like to think I wouldn't I still really love this girl.",1
My current bf does not care about guy friends and trusts me to not put myself in a precarious position. When does this feeling of guilt go away? I cant spend the rest of my life working and spending time at home away from other people. The level of anxiety is near panic attack and occasionally leads to one to the point where I dont eat and barely sleep for days. TL;DR: feeling guilty over nothing from being conditioned in a previously abusive relationship.,1
"It didn’t seem innocent. It looked like he’d seen something like that before and wanted someone to try it on. My parents were more strict and didn’t let me watch much things with violence, etc., and his were more lax, so maybe that was a factor. Also, he was the golden child in my extended family: charming, comedic, artistic. He got a pass a LOT.",0
"EDIT: I should also mention that when I do fall asleep, I snore REALLY loudly and I can hear myself in my sleep. My boyfriend says that it sounds like I'm not breathing or trying to breathe.   ---   **tl;dr**: I can't stay awake during tv/movies! Don't want it to drive a wedge between my boyfriend and I.",0
"For the last week, my car has been acting up. Yes, it's 16 years old but the only other person to have the car before I did was my 85 year old grandmother who only drove it to either the grocery store or the thrift store, so I got it almost brand new. But lately everything g has been going wrong. The gas gage doesn't work, the dash lights don't work, my tires need to be filled at least once every day, the brakes go out often, my battery won't start if it gets too cold, and now the transmission is starting to have issues. Without a job, I don't have money to pay to fix everything.",1
"I've stayed up at night hearing them quietly talk about things they can't pay right now, trying to figure out the order to deal with debts, what they can do to make this Christmas feel like normal. The only thing I know right now is that I don't know what is going to happen next. I don't know where my dad will live if he has to sell what he and my mother worked so hard for over the years. I don't know where my siblings and I will go if we run into troubles. I don't even know if my family will be able to afford any sort of funeral right now.",1
"Okay y'all first and foremost this is gonna be a long one, and I apologize for that. I'm looking for advice, information, help, honestly anything! So lets start at the beginning. For 2 years I've been working a full\-time hourly job, I was only getting paid minimum wage, however it was more then I had ever really made before and I was able to put money away. I felt secure enough to get a few credit cards that I used gently, got a 'adult' phone line ( T\-Mobile ) and was content with life.",0
"He gave me a pill to “stay awake,” claiming it was a caffeine pill. It didn’t seem to work. We started having sex, and right off the bat I could tell this was weird. He was completely quiet, wearing all of his clothes. He touched my labia (I have an innie vagina) and was like “What the fuck is this...”",0
"TL;DR: I wish to ask out my longtime friend this Valentines, but I am afraid of my past coming back and ruining my renewed trust with both her and my friends that I’ve worked years to repair. Note, what I am not scared of is rejection, I am scared of being feared or hated once again. How I most easily do away with the stigma revolving around my past  so that I can be judged by who I am now instead of who I was in the past? That’s what is keeping me up at night. I look forward to what the community has to say.",1
"We had begun to get more sexual, having to say hey let's not do anything this date instead of just doing something when it naturally happens and when we want it to. The reason why I told you about February is that I'm having that same feeling about being with someone else, only this time it's directed towards a particular girl. I've known this girl since 7th grade, I met my girlfriend in 9th grade when she moved here. I asked her out before my girlfriend and got lowkey denied, but she was too nice to tell me straight up no. I've changed significantly since then, however, and she's been subtly flirting with me for about a month.",0
"(Edit: sorry if this is very word-salad-esk and difficult to follow, this is one of the only times I’ve ever spoken about this, and the first time writing the entire thing down. It’s long, but it includes every detail that les to what happened. I would really appreciate anyone who wants to avoid any abuse or is going through abuse of an employer to learn from my mistakes, and be smarter and stronger than I was.) I had gotten my first retail job at a very popular hunting and fishing retail chain-store. I had been given the idea to work there by my boyfriend at the time.",0
"Hi, I'm 14F and because of health issues I missed a lot of school and eventually started homeschooling this year I didn't have any friends at public schools and I just sit in the house all day now. I can't join a sports team because of formerly mentioned health issues and I live in a town where a car is a necessity so it's not like I can walk anywhere but I'd like to make friends or just get out of my house for the first time in months and socialize face to face any ideas as to what I can do. TL;DR: I'm homeschooled lonely and can't join a sports team how do I make friends.",1
"I’m looking for work, mostly online jobs since I don’t have a car, but have also been applying for in person jobs and remote jobs, so I would need a phone for them to contact me. Would anyone be able to help me out? I can pay it back once I’ve got income again, and I can forward the confirmation to you to prove that it was paid. Or even if someone would be able to get me a cheap phone with some minutes on it, that would work too. Thank you for considering.",0
"To put it straight. I get anxiety when something changes on my body, be it hearing or any senses. I was in a car with my father and he has this 2K dollar professional stereo system in his car. He sat on the remote and all the sound went up to it's highest point. I was able to cover my ears, but with my forearms.",0
"Etc etc etc. "". My brain takes this one little choice -should I go back in the water- and blows it up so big that I spend 20 minutes trying to figure out what I should do, and I end up frozen unable to make ANY decision. Does this happen to anyone else? How do you deal with this?",1
"My ex sent me a video of a switchblade, I asked him why he had that and he said “cutting people up” and then he said “it’s an Italian style switch blade”.. I’m Italian... Anyways, he’s put a loaded gun to my head in the past. I’m actually pretty terrified of him now. He also once brought explosives to my brothers house and claimed he “forgot they were there”.. none of my family or our friends growing up believed me when I told them about him. Which is why I can’t talk to anyone.",1
Well I guess it was my second. Last week we set the ground work for the safe space to come back to if things got too overwhelming. This week we began to work through my trauma. Starting out the session was definitely very strange. I wasn’t sure what answers my therapist was looking for but once she assured me that there were no wrong answers everything went fine.,0
"For the remaining money, it is going toward the mother's back pay to the district and continue to supplement the personal care attendant, as a bonus to the compensation from the state agency. I'm out of other ideas on what more can we do to support this woman and her daughter? We setup a Gofundme page but I can't link it here at the moment. I'm trying to get anyones attention who would listen or offer any assistance. Thank You Reddit for all your help in advance.",0
(One is 3 yrs old and the other 19) . Now my dad would beat my mom but over the course of the years as I grew older he turned the violence onto me. He would see that I defended my mom and since I called the police one time (I found him choking her onto the wall) he stopped hurting her and transitioned into beating me. Now I know you guys may ask why did you continue to allow the abuse with you if you had stopped it with your mother before? Well I have an answer  to that my mother loved my father very much and every time I tried contacting the police she would stop me and I have a lot of love towards my mother and would do anything for her... but anyways back to the present we no longer live with him anymore and we have cut all ties with him except for my brother.,0
"(I should note, our first year together we went to the Maldives, second year we bought a house & went to Croatia, Venice, Belgium, Lots of weekends away - I'm not exactly lacking trips away) *I'm content and rarely feel unhappy these days, but is that a replacement of happiness? * Is this just a January blues thing that will go as the year starts moving on and I get back into the swing of things? ---",0
"So I'm unemployed, broke, no car or drivers licence (its suspended due to unpaid tickets). Unemployment ran out a month ago and I have no savings.

"One of them was “Catchphrase”. Similar to Taboo, but you pass around a device, and have to get your team to guess the word/phrase before the timer runs out. Of course, it has to make a countdown noise/beeping which makes me even more anxious. My partner has gotten quite good at gauging where I am on a scale of 1-10. He noticed that I was getting more tense as it was passed around the circle, headed towards me.",0
"He told me that we are at different places in life - he is looking to buy houses and I'm just starting grad school. I understand that I won't be financially stable for a few more years because I do have a student loan. But that being said I'm getting a master's in engineering so at worst I'm looking at a 5 year payback plan. He told me that he doesn't think we will work out long term because of being in different places. He thinks making adjustments to the differences between us will be ""forcing things to work out"".",0
"I will go homeless soon for reasons i can't stop, i roughly have 1000$ in cash and around 1000$ in possessions such as my PC, second PC, headphones etc etc etc. What should be the first thing i do aside from finding a job?

"He's been violent pretty much since 6months in. Nothing too horrendous at first just a slap or a punch or he'd spit in my face during an argument or grab me. I reasoned I could deal with that because he was always so remorseful and depressed afterwards. A year in we split up because he stole my car keys out of the ignition, got in the car and threatened to kill me rip out my hair and nails etc. I went to the police and they issued him with a domestic violence order.",1

"I had the depo shot for the first time at the beginning of March, decided to not go back for the 2nd because I wasn't a fan. Didn't experience any issues while on it , but once I came off of it, all hell broke loose. My once controlled anxiety became out of control and I had random days where I felt depressed/crying spells. The intrusive thoughts were out of control, and had an anxiety attack the 2nd week of working at my new job. I had to leave work and go home, which hadn't happened in almost half a year.",1
"Bust the stigma, don't whine but be frank, if you know or someone else that is struggling help the best you can, constantly let others know that yes they will not drown, there is a boat, and it fits way more than one person. The reality is the more you own and verbalize things, the more control you have over it and the less over you. Bottom line is busting the stigma, no one should feel like they are alone. So does my short little list work for everyone, totally not but I think it is a good reminder for people like myself..and hopefully someone else can take something away from it. If anything it's just got for me to verbalize it all out once in awhile.",0

She knows I'm sexually active and I don't have a boyfriend and is really judgmental about me having casual sex. I had a pregnancy scare last week (I'm not pregnant) and all I wanted was some advice from my mom and she used it as a way to make me feel bad about my sex life. When I was younger, she would constantly slut-shame me for things I hadn't even done, and made me feel so guilty about the idea of even having sex that I didn't have sex even with my year-long high school boyfriend because of this crippling guilt.

"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns.

The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life.

Ive been with my partner for a little over a year now. He has mild autism and is hard for him to deal with anger and emotions. He tends to black out i n rage and just break and smash things. Sadly we are young and broke so thearpy has been a hard option to find for a decent price. He got physical with me the other day and smashed my head into a wall.,1
"I knew she wasn't scamming as she was telling me this and it was definitely real when her membership card name matched her credit card (in case anyone things she was begging for pity). She told me the police only helped 2/7 times, because her husband and the police are in some sort of brotherhood so they won't do anything. As she was leaving she told me ""now I have to go back there again"" as she was sobbing. I didnt know what to say or what I could do to help. Everyone I've talked with as told me I should've gotten her phone number because looking her phone number up through our receipts and membership files is an invasion of privacy.",0
"Is it more than that? I have been considering finally confessing my secret because it feels like I am choking on it. I repress it as much as I can, but when it bubbles to the surface, it effects everything in my life. Thank you for listening/reading. I need help and I need to find the right way to deal and approach this.",1
I leave and breakdown in the kitchen because I’m still scared and freaked out. And the fact that I feel that I have to apologize for being triggered and am unable to control my reaction infuriates me. The part that confuses me is that when I was assaulted as a child I was never held down. I was frozen in fear. So why am I panicking over this seemingly innocent situation?,1

"The following week, my mom let me use her car to drive my brother to another city for an appointment. The car is going to be mine when she buys herself a new one, so I was really excited about driving it around more often. Everything was fine until I got to the actual city and then a woman drove through a red light and hit my mom's car. I held myself together because my younger brother was with me and he has his own depression to deal with, he didn't need to see his sister break down. The car was still driveable, so I dropped him off and his appointment and then had my meltdown in the drivers seat while explaining everything to my mom.",1
"You were so kind, thoughtful, and helpful. And right. I felt so exposed and vulnerable that I forgot a few things: my husband has *never* done something he knew would hurt me. More importantly, when I am not ok, he isn’t either, even though it doesn’t show. I don’t have a family of my own that I can trust, and it sucks.",0
"After that I ran to Mexico, just across the border to heal. I needed my daughter to get better to press charges. I didn’t want to risk him walking away free because my daughter wouldn’t talk.

He got angry that I assaulted him and threatened to take me to court. His mom freaked out over the condition he was in. She ended up taking him to the ER so we could see if he could set up an appointment and get medication on spot (we never dealt with something like this and didn't know the procedure).",0
"He came after me a few times so I got away and called cops. He was arrested, restraining order in place and he also had unregistered gun and no licence for them so he may be in trouble for that also. The hard part is he was good to my son, and now he is abruptly gone which is best, but I am not not sure how to explain to him. he is six and very sensitive and the spent a lot of time together. tl;dr boyfriend got aggressive and is jailed, how to tell young son why bf is gone now and we have to move soon?",1
"(Mind you we are all here from DSS/Social Services and in this homeless motel shelter) So now it is about 10:00pm and once again he knocks on their door and tells them to turn it down and to be quiet. Nope...that's just not going to happen, as soon as he was out of earshot the cRap music and loud partying resumed. So I sit in my room perplexed as what to do about this,(wanting to get some much needed sleep) as it seems asking them to turn the music down and to quiet down was not going to happen. (obviously they're above the rules and law and don't give a shit about others in the motel) So I sat there thinking and I decided to call the owner/manager one last time and tell him PLEASE get these people to be quiet and turn the music down and to quit being so damn loud. He tells me ""I have told them 2 times to turn the music down and be quiet and they won't listen to me, why don't you call the police yourself"" I was floored by him saying this to me and told him it was NOT my job to enforce the rules, it was his.",1

I’m noticing a pattern where my body is like rejecting my partner and I’m concerned it might be caused by my abuse at an early age. Should I seek counseling? But I’m afraid if I do I’m going to have to talk more about what happened and I’m going to break. I’ve talked to therapist before but whenever the topic of the abuse arises I tense up and can’t remember anything. I’m sorry if I’m rambling on it’s just a hard subject for me to talk about and I don’t know how to put into words the emotions I feel towards these events.,1

So I have ptsd from an abusive relationship I ended about 3 years ago. When I felt healthy enough I went to therapy and did emdr and it helped and I thought i was doing well. I even moved to a different state so I could quit triggering my flashbacks a year and a half ago and haven't had a single flashback until last night. I have started dating a guy I'm pretty smitten about and last night we went out with friends and had a really good time but we also had been drinking. Something triggered me and i had a flashback and was not able to control my emotions because I had been drinking it was like I went from laughing having a good time to having a panic attack and asked him if we could leave and we did.,1

"And I think it's important to get to know someone for a bit before making a decision to live together. I'm happy to send pictures of me, talk via voice, webcam, or whatever. The major restriction I have is that it will have to be at specific times because my abusive partner is home most days. I also will have to speak with anyone on secret messaging accounts when the abusive partner is not home, so I am not always available to talk about this but I check those accounts as much as possible. Due to anticipated trolling and people just asking questions that I've already answered (like telling me to go to a shelter instead), rather than coming back to all these posts (I'm posting this on a ton of websites) to see the replies, I'm just going to let anyone who is serious about speaking to me message me privately through the following places.",0

Nothing is being absorbed in that stupid brain of mine, wherever the hell it is when I should be doing something more productive like studying or reading but either my own brain rotted to the size of a pea *(because of how mental disorders degenerate brain cells ... yay me, I am doing something at all)* or it just felt and flew up to Mars, or it is sitting its dark throne,  rubbing its pitchfork,  planning its next move on how to fuck me, both literally and figuratively.",1
Currently in s constant state of anxiety with heart palptations. Woke up this morning with panic attacks. We broke up 4 months ago (it happened suddenly over text) as the relationship was shaky. Is there anything I can do about this? Conciously I'm not trying to think about the situation but unconsciously I still have the physical symptoms (anxiety/panic/heart rate and palpitations).,1
i faced up to myself. i completed probation. it's not the drugs i need. it's to leave my environment and everything i know; it's to get a fresh start. i'm only 22.,0
"CW: mentions of self-harm, suicide I feel so overwhelmed. The flashbacks, the panic attacks, being triggered so easily, sometimes by mere words alone. I get so entrenched in my flashbacks that I can barely medicate myself, and my friend has to intervene and give me a good dose of clonazepam to get me out of it. I can't talk about my trauma, it sends me straight into a state of anxiety and panic.",1
I’m looking for advice to try to help a relative. She’s going through a very ugly divorce with her husband who’s trying to get sole custody of their three-year-old son. He’s dating a woman with a substance abuse problem and a criminal record. He met her three weeks ago and has been taking their son to sleep at her residence (unbeknownst to my relative till recently). This Monday he told her he’s filing for divorce.,0

"Did I mention my parents are religious? I don't know if this is normal for religious people to treat. Whenever I tell them I'm terrified of being homeless they tell me I'm a ""acting like a baby"" and ""get over it"" my parents parents did not treat them this way. They're basically mad because they(I guess 30 or 40 years ago were different when they were my age? Because they said they both lived on their own at 17 and that they find it creepy I'm 16+ and they find it creepy being around me).",1
"Hi PTSD forums, Selective mutism has been something i have been afflicted with for 7 years since middle school. It was only in senior year of high school that I began speaking again thanks to the help of a few friends whom i no longer am in contact with and also my football coach/teacher. Now in college however I dread presentations. Often, I would lock down and say one or two sentences and after that say ""i'm done, ill hand it off to my group member"" or I would splurge out incoherent sentences that have no purpose or thought behind them during presentations and people would have a confused look on their faces.",0
"If you intervene he will stoop down to the lowest level cursing his sons out with the worst imaginable. First the obvious question, is this domestic abuse? Domestic violence? Am I imagining this or blowing it out of proportion? I'm in Canada, are there any legal avenues we can use to end this?",1
"Thank you for reading and for your time. Update: I should probably add that I was terrified of my mom and never tried to provoke her. I never snuck out, never got in trouble at school, no drugs, no drinking, no bad friends, tried to keep my grades up as best as I had time for, and never ever back talked; even though I dreamt of serving it to her one day. My siblings would cry whenever they didn’t get what they wanted, they were rather spoiled, and would tell on me if I didn’t do what they wanted. Mom would be in the middle of homework or class and she’d just wail on me for no reason.",1
"I never felt so uncomfortable and scared other than the night he did put his hands on me and it was exact same feeling today. That was the scariest part. It felt like that night never ended and I was just at the peak of emotion. I know most of you will say ‘you need to leave’ or something obvious - yes I know. But things aren’t that easy and than there’s a me that is holding on to a stupid fucking thread of hope that he, of all people, will change.",1
"Due to daughters older sibling and mother being the type that craves and feeds on enormous emotional attention, I am realizing how she's ended up making herself smaller and downplaying her own problems to not ""add to the burden"". AFAIK there has been no physical abuse, but there has been geographical and emotional abandonment from mother and brother, and probably a feeling of emotional abandonment from myself. She's smart and ambitious, but unfortunately totally lacking in self-confidence and has a habit of choosing away people and situations. I realize that through a life of undiagnosed ADD I've adopted a myriad of ""bad habits"" I will need to address for both mine and our sakes, as well as a ton of structure etc that need to be put in place. In that frame it would be very helpful to start at an end that benefits both of us, or at the very least doesn't exacerbate her PTSD.",0

"Those are all the ones I can coherently explain. I've also felt extremely lonely and I've been craving touch more than I did before I was with him.

"He is our little angel and we are both gaga for him, but money has been extraordinary tight, adjusting to parent life and sleep deprivation has been tough for both of us. We were fighting and bickering a bit for the first time in his first months of life, but I figured that was normal for new parents. I work in the financial industry for a modest income (working hard currently to get to the next level where I'll make substantially more) and she works for an arts-based nonprofit.

"I had no problem with that, but was kind of surprised that this was the first time I was hearing his cousin's name that he missed so dearly he spent 600 dollars on a plane ticket to go visit. I did not think much of it, but noticed that over the course of a couple weeks, he was constantly getting snapchats from Jessica, but was reluctant to open them in front of me. That was another thing that surprised me because he always would open things in front of me, and never had a problem with me on his phone. If he did open a snapchat from Jessica, he kind of pulled his phone closer to him so I couldn't see his screen. I noticed his phone background one day, and saw that it was a happy birthday card with a picture drawn on it, signed from Jessica.",0
"But the second time I was getting off the bus, and as I turned to walk up my street, I noticed him driving up beside me and commencing the same pattern.

"But I have two questions - 1) should I stop hanging out with these men altogether? My therapist and mother have told me they don't think what these men confessed were a big deal because they were so young while it happened. And 2) I kind of want to tell the most recent guy that him confessing that to me made me uncomfortable, but I don't know if I should or not. I need help because I don't always have the best judgment of what to do and I'm not always the best judge of character.

"Rubbing with shoulders with people and socializing too frequently may also be source of stress as the soul and body needs to re-energize it frequently.

That was the only question I stumbled on, so that might have given an inclination that I am homeless.",0
My anxiety and ocd have been terrible the last few weeks. I've recently started drinking again (stupid I know) and I'm feeling like I need to use it as a crutch again.

I have been having the worst sinus and headache flare ups.,1

"At the same time, I’ve been going crazy because if I’m not thinking about something else I’m thinking about him and various kink related acts. This isn’t anything I’ve actually experienced before (hell, I still don’t get attraction), so I’m confused. My issue is, he’s going back overseas for uni in a couple of days, and we’ll be seeing each other (in our larger group) tomorrow. Should I bring something up? Should I just leave it?",1

I explained my situation without giving him how long I’ve been homeless but said I’d be back on my feet by December. That was at the beginning of the conversation.

"It’s resulted in me coming up with excuses to not hang out with him, which, yes, I feel bad about. Through my interactions with him, I have gotten the hint that Jack is interested in me, in a more-than-friends kind of way. I don't want to assume this as a fact—it's certainly possible that he is just trying to make a new friend. Along with many small hints that he *is* interested in me, however, the biggest hint is probably whenever I mention my boyfriend. I have a boyfriend of about a year, and whenever I do mention him, Jack seems very visibly uncomfortable.",0

"I never personally did anything beyond a ""show me yours and I'll show you mine"" type of thing where another kid and I would see how we ""measured up"", but it felt like those experiences had heavily sexual undertones for me - I don't know if that was me figuring things out or if my mind went there from what happened to me cousin. When I was about 13 I remember thinking to myself that it was crazy that so many of my peers knew what they wanted - I was just really, really confused. I said to myself ""I don't know what I like or which team I go, and I bet that's because of what happened between me and my cousin. I'll figure it out when I'm older"" and that was it. I did what a lot of other kids my age were doing - I hopped online and watched lots of porn.",0

Hello r/Assistance. I want to go to rehab for my cocaine addiction I live in the USA where rehab has a bad stigma sadly.

I have now the plan to focus more on the anxiety with the meds. I also think that Pregabalin is a quiet good drug for that, but I was questioning how it will affect my cognition (because I startet studying) and want to hear your experiences guys.",0
"I'll try to keep this short. I've never been able to feel empathy towards other people, I'm not a sociopath or anything (as far as I know), I know when I should feel bad for/with somebody but I can't make myself care as much as I want to. _ Anyways, my mothers best friend of 45 years just killed himself and she's pretty torn up about it. I gave her a hug and what not but I have no idea what else I'm supposed to do.",0
"I hate that I am this way--I have a normal job, but all that has rotted away because out of the past 2 years, I spent 7 of those months in various hospitals and treatment using FMLA unpaid. I have so many fucking medical bills sitting in collections. I still have my job thanks to FMLA, but I am a rotting piece of shit living life minute by minute, losing a war against addiction and depression and anxiety. But...I somehow manage to ""look fine"" and I look like I should be thriving on paper. I feel like such a fraud, but I swear I am not trying to take advantage of the system or anything.",1

"It is the winter and Tyler and I have been going out ice fishing a lot, it’s nice because I get to spend time with him and it’s something we both like to do. Well, once Zack found out, he tells Tyler all the time how they should go, etc. Well, Tyler fills up his truck (it is never under $120), fills up the four-wheeler ($60), and Zack walks over to our house with nothing but a helmet. He has absolutely no ice fishing gear, but knows Tyler does and, again, uses Tyler under the guise of “friendship” so he can go. AKA, I don’t get to go anymore.",0
"I feel like I have the worst luck with everything, but maybe that's just bias. I feel like life has dealt me a short hand and I feel so guilty saying this because there are people out there with lives far worse than mine.

"I've always had this slight urge to drop out of society since my early teens. Nothing I've taken all that seriously until now though.

"I recently became depressed and am now understanding that I’ve also had anxiety my whole life but I am waiting to see a specialist to have a diagnosis. My doctor is pretty easy goin and will give me pretty much whatever medication I want. Lately I’ve been trying this and trying that to find a good combination of meds. My foquest would make me very depressed in the evenings and morning so I went off foquest and went on Wellbutrin XL at 150mg a day. This helped my depression but my attention, memory, and focus faltered.",1
"On his 21st birthday, he consumed way too much alcohol to celebrate, and I regrettably saw an entire different side of him. I noticed that he had crazy eyes, and he was being very aggressive in speech. He seemed very off to me, and demanded to know why I didn't want to sleep in his bed that night. When I made up the excuse that I had to be up for something early in the morning, he demanded to know what was wrong with our relationship. I kept calmly assuring him that we were fine, and that I just needed rest that night.",0

I was out of his league (his words).",0
"I wondered if anyone else had a similar place that they always found themselves in. I can't decide if it's healthy or not since most of the traumatic things that happened at home were in that space. I'll find myself camped out, sobbing on the floor, but can't really pinpoint why it's the place I always seek out. Secondly; if it's not helping me recover, how can I make the rest of my house more appealing? I'm not consciously choosing to end up in the kitchen it's just where I go.",1
"We are down to less than $100 for another week and 4 days. Her weight watchers is due, and she is sad we may have to cancel.

I am looking for $100 so I can give her money towards weight watchers.",0
"Which forced me to acknowledge that I haven’t been performing to my own expectations. Enter the anxiety attack. Sobbing, shaking, fidgeting, and rambling. To top it all off, I threw away my xanex thinking that I didn’t need the safety net. I thought I was done with all this...reality proved otherwise.",1
"When I left my buddy's house, I went to an organic farm where I volunteered for a little while out in nature where I could clear my head. I really enjoyed it immensely but quickly realized I would not be able to get ahead or make a living for myself though I learned a lot of valuable skills that I can take with me along the way in this journey. I came back after about a month to the DFW metroplex where I reside now with my dad, step mom and 6 siblings. I stay in a humble shack in the backyard that we fixed up with a cot and a/c and an extension cord. Because of my dad allowing me to stay, I was able to get a job and am expecting my first paycheck on the 5th of September.",0

If I want internet on my laptop, I download the PdaNet+ app, download the .exe app on my phone then transfer to my laptop, install the app, then switch the tethering on so my laptop can connect and have access. That way, I can apply for more jobs on sites that my phone can't open up. So far, I'm doing okay. Just thought I would like to share how's my day been doing.",0

"I realized that maybe it's better if we break up even though I love him so much and he's one of the most important people in my life. It's already hard enough to decide to break up with someone you love and it's even harder when you can't do It because the person won't show up. If we werent together for so long, I'd probably would've just blocked him already and carry on. But I don't want that. I want to keep being friends.",0
"I told him if he’s not careful, all this attention could make her fall in love with him. For a while, I noticed the behavior stopped. He wouldn’t stay up as late, they stopped working out for a little bit, the glances and flirting stopped, and I noticed they weren’t talking as much, because they both talked to me more. However, recently it has started back up again, and almost as strongly as before. They do all the same things again, and they are always making eye contact with eachother or teasing and flirting.",0
"He doesnt seem bothered about calling me or meeting me unless I initiate. We dont talk for very long as he still lives with his parents and is apparently always ""busy"" helping his mum. Im mostly available, as I work part time as Im a student but I live in a rented shared flat. We seldom talk about the future. I want to talk about the future, I planned to work abroad this year as I graduate soon but stopped those plans after meeting him as he is only in college and will take another 3 years until he finishes education.",0
Someone I know has been compulsively chattering their teeth. They told me it started because they could feel their teeth wobble a little when they clenched their teeth together while feeling them with their finger (we all know this is just one of those weird tricks the teeth play on you) but it's become compulsive now. They told me they feel ill from it. They don't have any anxiety issues and the chattering is just a result of the above but I can see how it would become one. What can be done to make this go away?,0
"I was consuming quite a lot of caffeine (up to 500mg per day) during the summer and I'm medicated with 18mg methylphenidate for ADHD. (I was rarely taking caffeine with methylphenidate together as there are a lot of side effects after doing that, one of them is anxiety and increased heart rate). I don't take methylphenidate now because of the high bp and my chest pains. I have an appointment to the cardiologyst but until then I'll have all my trial exams.

"If he's the textbook abuser, she is the textbook victim. She keeps giving him chances and accepting his apologies and living in this cycle of abuse. She thinks she's the one doing something wrong.

"She treated me like a freaked-out horse. It was clearly effective. Today, my marriage is different.

"I work as a security guard at a busy office building and everytime i make eye contact with my people  I can literally see them shuddering inside. It probably down to the fact I have an intense stare and tend to stare in people's too eyes long,but I don't know what  the social etiquette is ,what do you do when you're walking along a corridor and you bump into someone you just said hi to a few seconds ago, what do you do when you turn around and unintentionally lock eyes with a work colleague. Please someone help,teach my how to make normal eye contact in social situations. It's getting to the point now where work colleagues are going out their  way to avoid making eye contact with me. Please help",1

"Perhaps it is weird to process something after such a long time, but not really. I always felt strong at how I managed to leave, but I never had any closure. I got out of the relationship and pretended nothing ever happened. Just wanted to share I had an eye-opening experience tonight and I feel at peace about everything that happened now because I have deep down, stopped blaming myself. Looking back at every experience I had with him, the mental torture I went through, I cannot believe what I dealt with, but now finally feel ok.",0
"I wonder what I would be like if I had gotten help earlier on. **Here's where I could use some input: I don't consider myself mentally ill. I hate the word. If someone asked me if I was, I'd deny it but I know I have PTSD and I guess that does make me ill by definition. Will I be considered mentally ill forever?",1
"I think it’s possible that these feelings are coming from the fact that he has said he loves me while drunk but can’t say it sober. I haven’t brought his up to him, but it makes me feel like he can’t say it because of his ex. Which I understand, but it also makes me sad that he’s not excited to be in love with me. I think part of me also feels like a second choice, or like I’m being compared to her. It’s eapecially awful when I think about how ready I would have been to to go back to my ex when I was still heartbroken.",1

I had not read anything about it prior, and had entirely avoided any medical or mental health people. After the suicide attempt, which over nine years, head been preceded by the traumatic end of a highly dysfunctional five year relationship, followed by a severe four year alcohol problem.

"Hi guys, I have PTSD that came from a suicide related incident. I'm not ready to talk about what happened, but it was pretty recent so even the small things are triggering. This timing couldn't possibly be worse, 13 reasons why is gaining popularity incredibly quickly and the ads are popping up everywhere. I'm getting help, but these things take time and I can't just quit the internet. Is there any way I block that specific type of ad?",1

I told her I thought it was a bad idea, that she should finish what she had left (she's an excellent student, super smart and committed) and then go to study the other career.

"I was diagnosed with PTSD after I was assaulted when I was 18, but to be honest I've never really felt like I had it. I can usually push things down so deeply that I don't feel many repercussions of what I've been through aside from a lot of shame. In the last 4 months though, someone who's been on and off harassing me since I was 17 has resurfaced. He was sending me hundreds of texts and calling me saying things varying from ""you're going to marry me and we can have kids and live together forever"" to ""you're a whore and you're a disgusting person and I want to (insert threat) you"". He makes fake accounts and tries to add me or adds my friends accusing them of taking me from him.",1
"I barely slept in the hospital because I stayed up at night and listened for codes with his room number. I was terrified, constantly living in fear from the moment I awoke until about his 7th day in the hospital when he seemed clearer, and sat up with assistance for the first time. Fast forward to now. We are lucky to be alive, and we are injured. We’ve been robbed of a normal engagement, of the experience of moving in together, and that’s a grieving process...but my mind...is not what it was.",1
"It's something that I continually come back to when I am thinking about my anxiety, and how it manifests. Lately, I have found some consistent stability with zoloft, and therapy. Long story short, after about half a year of being unemployed due to panic attacks at work causing me to be miserable, I am ~5 weeks back into a new job in a different field, on an SSRI, and feeling more or less great. As a result, I've had some more time to focus on what actually triggers my anxiety, rather than fighting off daily bouts of throwing up from panic. Sometimes, it's reading about politics, other times, it's ruminating over a perceived medical issue, or something ""big"" I need to do at work, or in the near future.",0
"Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my main account. For some background, 30 yo male diagnosed with GAD, depression and PTSD. Otherwise healthy, but recently my anxiety has been getting worse and showing itself in the most fucking frustrating way.

I don't want to go into the details at this point but that relationship shattered my trust in people and, frankly,  myself.",1
"I used to be a very touchy feely person pre trauma, hell I'd have stood out in a big city with a sign for free hugs, I *wanted* to. I'd touch a leg for sympathy, throw an arm around shoulders for comradeship. My family was never like that growing up. Until recent years, I rarely got hugs from parents or my brother and when we'd brush legs while sitting, it'd be an awkward ""oh sorry"" and a shuffle to separate. The latter is still true but I make it a joke.",1
"They took me to a Bar and bought me a beer.. ‘Tonight you sleep here’, miming sleep and pointing at a long wooden table. So night 1 was in a bar. And so it went, I’d arrive in some village at night and just be sitting on a curb waiting for some opportunity to arise when people would retire and I could sleep rough. Almost every second night, I seemed to be engaged by some local who would take me home: to sleep in a heavenly bed, to sleep in a barn, to sleep on a floor.. whatever, I was inside and it cost my small purse nothing.",0
"I was talking to my mom this morning and she said that about my sister. Her trauma was worse than mine but she didn't develop PTSD. (My mom has no idea I even had a traumatic event) I told her it's not that easy, and she said it just needs to be done. Now I am scared.",1
"October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month and I am a domestic violence survivor who is still struggling, even after over four years. Lately I have been feeling very angry. Angry that my abusive ex received no real consequences for his actions.

"However, I've vaguely brought it up before and she said that she wants to also invest one day. My gut feeling is that she's comfortable if we both pay rent and lose money, but might feel weird if one person is benefitting and the other person is not.

We were friends, but I think time has changed him and I and I don't think we would be friends if we met today.

"This lead to a series of tests which basically showed that he had developmental issues and as he only ever eats junk food and soda showed that hes pretty much decaying. He has some memory issues now and can't really be trusted to live on his own like he could but he'd need a care taker to come in once a week to make sure he's eating, hasn't burned the house down, etc. Anyways I bring this up because at this time in life I was praying to God to kill him or to at least get him out of our lives so I took this incident as either A)Gods way of making me eat my words or B)This was the answer to my prayers as he technically is dying by grdual decay.....slowly",0

He will smoke weed and go to work and come home and never clean his dishes or anything. He’s turned into this monster who doesn’t care about anyone and will get rid of everyone if they inconvenience him even a little and he’s obsessed with money and making music.

I got a call a few days ago but couldn't get an interview scheduled because during the call the hr lady got an email that the person I would interview with would be unavailable and I didn't have my work schedule right in front me so we decided to talk again the next day once we both had an idea of what the schedules for each side would be. Well the next day I called her and she still hadnt heard back from the person I would interview with and promised to call me the next day.,0
"All things considered it didn't stand out aside from being the first time I got involved. I could give a description of how it went down, but I'm not going to for privacy reasons. Most of the times I wouldn't be able to do that any more than the average person can tell you what they had for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks at any given day years ago. It all gets mixed up in my head. I usually react badly to anniversaries of incidents that involve being blamed for someone dying.",0
"Weird title I know but I really couldn’t find any other way to describe what I’m feeling and I really struggled to think if I should post this on here or another group So for as long as I can remember I’ve always been attracted to women and only women I had absolutely no interest in men at all A few years back I had my first relationship which was really manipulative and physically abusive and I haven’t been on any dates since then Recently though (like in the last two weeks) it’s accused to me that bar an old crush from before my ex “kinda-sorta” coming back I haven’t found any women attractive at all in a while at least a year and whenever I see someone I would have normally found attractive I just get a nervous/uncomfortable feeling I can’t really describe I’m not sure if this is a response to how my ex used to get abusive if she thought I was attracted to her (like she’d insist I must want to rape her if I called her beautiful for example) and I know for a long time afterwards I felt disgusted with myself if I found someone attractive so this may just be the next step in that, like my mind doesn’t want me to feel bad for finding someone attractive so it stops finding people attractive",1
"Almost too well. She extends our date twice, buys us a drink each, starts a make out session which lasts for 2 hours, calls me hot, and although neither of us had a house free she gave me oral too. Although she said she had a great time - which I replied to - I then waited to respond to her next message, and I don't know if that killed any momentum because I was already very delayed when we first got talking of course. Anyway, despite our great date and a second one lined up when I asked her out a day later, she ended up cancelling on me, and then told me a week later that she got more serious with another guy - which to me only translated as him being hot and me being ugly. They broke things off a week later, and she did ask me out again, but at one stage I annoyed her with a jokey message.",1
"I'm not sure why I'm making this post, really. I guess I'm afraid. Is houston ""safe"" to be homeless in, compared to other cities? I'm 5'10"" and about 150 lbs, so I don't think anyone would mess with me, but...I have seen some of the homeless people here and I really hope I don't offend anyone, but they look crazy :/ I'm sure it's very rough for men, also, but being a 22 year old homeless woman is a terrifying thought. where do I sleep?",1
"I've been trying to act like nothing happened but I can't stop thinking about all this. I feel weird that i'm even thinking about it so much. I should just brush it off.

"My Father has been struggling with alcoholism for nearly his entire life, he hasn’t been in contact with myself, my mom, or my sister in years. I guess it all of sudden caught up with him, he past away from a heart attack recently. It still doesn’t feel real, but my girlfriends family has been nothing but supportive throughout the whole thing and helped me grieve through his death. Needless to say, I do not want to attend a funeral or memorial, because I’d like to remember the good times I had with him and not being up bad memories. I had a rough child hood, he cheated on my mother, he wasn’t a great guy.",1
"I tried multiple times to get him to join in on the fun but my attempts unintentionally put him on the spot and had the reverse effect. Truthfully, I got distracted after a while trying to get lucky. I feel guilty because I don't know how to help him in those situations. What if anything can I do to help him come out of his shell? Should I just let him be?",0
"My brother and I usually get along but for some reason, he makes me really angry, to the point that I don't like who I become. I'm a pretty level-headed guy and never really yell or get angry at anyone but for some reason **when it comes to my brother the anger I get is so overwhelming**. He's the only one that can get me to that point of anger where I start sweating and shaking. He's never ""hurt"" me in a major way before and all the things that annoy me are little things like ignoring me, not responding to me when I talk to his lack of eye-contact and him generally ignoring/disregarding my attempts of communication. I don't wanna be like this towards him and I don't really know what to do.",1
"(TW sexual abuse mentions) When I was 14 I was sexually abused regularly for 8 months, resulting in PTSD, and recently I realised that afterwards I completely changed how I looked. I went from being this pretty normal looking student, short cropped hair, I would wear normal casual clothing on weekends, I was healthy, all that, now, over three years later I look completely different, I'm stick thin, hair grown out past my shoulders, I only wear black and almost always clothes that cover as much of me as possible, heavy scarring covering the majority of my body, and messy facial hair growing in. I feel like I've completely altered myself so nobody is tempted to hurt me again, like I'm blaming how I looked for what happened, so completely changing it seemed like the most sensible thing. I've never heard of anyone else doing this before though, is this normal?",1
"I let out a loud whistle, as we often invited new comers to go ride. The guy on the black bike was named Devin. Devin had just moved to town a couple weeks prior and had posted in our facebook group looking for friends to ride with. After talking for a couple more minutes, we took off on our adventure.

Sadly, since I'm in a dorm, it's a shitty hallow core door and it broke bad and now there is a hole that I have to figure out how to fix. It's a $100 fine if I can't figure out what to do with it so that's just compounding on the already existing stress. I have $3 to my name right now, I luckily get paid Friday so I will be able to pay for my car, but I'm still left with only $100 for 2 weeks and I have to figure out how to pay for my textbook for my night class.

"I’ve truly been inspired to be more generous with complements and lifting others up. I’ll never know what affect it may have on someone! 💕 it could make their day.

"I would be lying if I said using heroin didn’t get more tempting everyday. Atleast I could either slowly die high and numb, or accidentally high and numb.

Original frustrating moment: <url> Writing this so y'all can see what kind of people I'm dealing with! I called up the non-profit this morning to ask if I can use another identification document instead of my birth certificate because getting a BC from the clerks dept in my town cost $28 which I don't have. I asked for the girl that I talked to yesterday since she would know what my situation is but the gentlemen who answered the phone told me that she nor her supervisor was in and that I should call back on Monday and talk to Cassandra or her supervisor to reschedule my appointment that was set up for this morning. Ok I said then hung up.,0
"She wants to do anything she can do to help me, but it's up to the state, not her, to charge me. I have, and documented once I got out of jail, a puncture bite on my right hand, a puncture bite on my left inner elbow, deep scratches all over my left arm, The skin on my scrotum was torn (the jail underwear they gave me was soaked at the end of the day) my lip busted open, a chipped tooth, my whole right side of my face red and sore from a dozen punches, and a welt on my left leg from her kicking me.  Now I'm being charged with 4th degree DV and need legal counsel to prove my innocence.

"Wondering if anyone has this same problem and if anyone has found a way of overcoming it. Regardless of who messages me (family, friends, strangers) I avoid opening the message (text message, email, social media message, calls, voicemails) and avoid replying until hours later or even the next day. I don’t know why I do this, but I feel like it takes so much of my energy to open the message and reply and it’s almost like I don’t want to have a continuous conversation with anyone. It’s very bad for trying to maintain healthy relationships. Does anyone else suffer with this from anxiety?",1

"So I found a counselor who I like and I've been to the first session where she got my background and overview of my problems I guess. Then, we went right in and she had me working on coping strategies etc. and she said in the future what things we will work on. So my question is: I didn't really say everything that I've had trouble with and how much it really affects me. Like she knows most of it, but between my parent being in the room part of the time and the nervousness of being there, I realized I didn't say everything.",0

"Example 2.

In the past when we were together I stupidly sent him private photos of myself and he threatens to send them to my church, my parents, and my bosses. He says he will do whatever he can to ruin my life and see that I lose my job and lose the respect of everyone in my life and have legal consequences go using his money (which again, he said I could but now he’s saying I’m lying). I feel like he literally dictates my life. He breaks things in my apartment.",1
And I really don't know what to do.

I never thought I’d be in a situation like that in my life and the screaming and blood and chaos following it is just on a constant repeat in my head that won’t stop. I had to give 4 separate statements to the police which burned it from start to finish in my brain and it doesn’t stop.

"I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on. Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible.

"How could I when I felt so unwelcome? Idk, I'm sorry, I'm just so sick of carrying on when it's so fucking exhausting just to be told that it's never bloody fucking good enough for anyone. I'm fucking trying so hard. They claim to understand that I have ""issues"" (I had confided before they abandoned me) yet I'm never fucking good enough. I just want to drink a bottle of bleach and be fucking done with it.",1
Im not physically hurt. My father abd the driver carry on a conversation as if im not screaming. We get to the hospital and the checkup reveals nothing. Im embarrased for screaming. They send us home.,0
We'd be saving so much money with this new housr...its such an expensive city.... I did some googling in their language and found that it was illegal for them to do that. I was excited like oh ok if it happens ill call the police on them....  but now i did some further googling and turns out that if you sign the contract with that in it than everything is on their side... The contract is long term so we'd have to give 6months notice before leaving even if we give it next week ill still have to live six months with this.... i wanna die i swear i havent been so helpless and scared in so long.... Also two days ago my friend mentioned he ran into my ex who ruined my life and that he told him he wants to see mw and get closure.,1
"At times, he would get stalker-ish, and she would remove him from her contacts. This would infuriate him, and he would create an alternate character to threaten her, saying how he is going to find her, kill her, and tell me about their relationship. Being scared, my wife would add him back, pretend to be friends, only to repeat this cycle over several times over the next few years. Yes, they somehow remained ""friends"" for years after this affair. The next stab came when I was sent to an Air Force base for a 3 month training for my job.",0
"My situation is that I might be homeless for about a month. I have plenty of money coming in from my clients during the month of October--more than enough to meet the 3x income requirement for most apartments in the city where I plan to move (my hometown). However, my lease here ends Sept 30. I don't have quite enough to meet the 3x income requirement before then. Some of my clients have really slow pay schedules.",1
"Last night, I had a few friends over for New Years', as one does. We all got pretty damn drunk, as one does. Among my drunk friends was my good friend ""Lily,"" someone who I've been friends with for a while. A long time ago, she told me she had romantic feelings for me. I turned her down, being in a relationship, but admittedly I had a small crush on her too.",0
"Every once in a while I get the concept of death stuck in my mind. Thinking I’m not going to be here anymore, thinking my parents won’t be here, thinking what’s going to happen after I die. Just thinking about how we all are mortal. That gives me such bad anxiety I disassociate and I try to go back to normal, I can’t. I’m in that state right now and I really don’t know what to do.",1
"Sometimes it goes into an actual panic attack, but not too often. My husband has recently banned me from going anywhere alone unless absolutely necessary (like to work).

"It’s been 12 hours since it’s started and I genuinely can’t get it to stop. It’s been so bad that my tongue is actually really starting to hurt. Has this happened to anyone else before? ?

"I was talking to my counselor today about my anxiety disorder, and he suggested to me that I try to reframe my anxiety as excitement, as they cause the same adrenal response. He suggested I view this adrenal response as simply “emotional arousal to something something novel.” This conversation caused me to have the revelation that for at least the past 5 years, I haven’t been able to experience anything “exciting” as something other than anxiety inducing. Things like first dates, roller coasters, etc. are all miserable for me because of my heightened nervous response.",1

"These weren't the only punishments, though. Sometimes he'd make us choose a favorite toy or plushie to be thrown out if we'd made him mad, and one time when he caught me rescuing my plushie, he slapped me across the face, then made me watch him cut her into little pieces, standing there at 1 in the morning berating me about how I was a stupid, ignorant little bitch that needed right and wrong beaten into her, because I was too stupid to to know how to do as I was told. Sometimes, though, he'd not just snap and get angry... He'd utterly lose control of himself. Screaming so furiously I couldn't really understand him, grabbing me by the arms/shoulders and shaking me hard enough to give me whiplash, and continue screaming over me once I collapsed in a cowering heap when he let go.",0
"Switching my major to something I’d actually enjoy would add in years to my education and everyone would be like “wtf you need to just commit and finish it because of the money you’ve paid and time etc” because it’s not like I’m 22 anymore or whatever. But I dream of a career involved in science, something morbid or outdoors. I feel like I’m too old to be indecisive.

"Spring 2102 I began to see a man that I worked with and that only made my roommate jealous and angry. I went to a pdoc (who was basically a pharmaceutical dispensary and appointments only lasted 15 minutes) who diagnosed me with ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder and caffeine dependency. My ex-roommate(who had PTSD from fighting in Iraq and BPD) became jealous that I was hanging out with and spending all my time with a man that was not him, he began to hide my prescription anxiety and sleep medication so I would have to spend more time at my apartment and with him. Late summer 2012 I was able to catch him doing a series of illegal things, had him arrested for petty theft and evicted him from the apartment. I spent a couple months more in the apartment and ultimately ended up moving in with the man I had begun to see (he and I have now been together almost 5 years).",0

"On top of that, I also haven't taken the ACT, because I didn't think I'd even consider college. I literally feel like I know nothing and am completely unprepared for the ACT no matter how much I study, because I never payed attention in my classes. More things stressing me out are politics and family. But, not as much as the school / job thing. And I haven't reached out to anyone to tell them how stressed I am, and I feel it seems so stupid, and I'm sorry.",1
"The $4 cable I usually get fr Dollarama is out of stock, the cheapest I can find is $7 at a different dollar store, but nothing less than $30 at London Drugs and The Source. Here's where it gets complicated: my bank account is in a weird limbo right now and I don't know how much to ask for. My current balance is about $3, but my monthly service charges haven't been applied yet. So I know I'm going to be overdrawn, but the service charge varies depending on how many transactions I did, so I don't know how much I'll be overdrawn. Looking over the last 6 months the charge has ranged from $6 to $24.",0
"Hi, all. I'm manager of my department now, at the company I've worked at for over 4 years. I was offered the position once before about a year and a half ago, but I turned it down because I felt I wasn't ready.

"But my brain defaulted into my stoned embarrassment. Just having this idea people hate me when they don’t, missing my dad and punishing myself for not being able to help my dad through his alcoholism. Not that he deserves it.

(I suffer from Major Depression/Anxiety/Fibromyalgia and I wrote this as an example of what I feel on an average day so that people who don't have mental illness can understand) Hollowed out doesn't quite cover the feeling.

"I used my forearm to push the plate I was eating from off the counter. A glass bowl fell to the floor as well and shattered. The noise woke my dad up, who went to bed nearly black out drunk a couple hours before this. He immediately started screaming at my friends to “get the fuck out” and aggressively pushing them out of the back door. He then grabbed me by my arm and shoved me out the door yelling “take her fucking ass with you.” My friends sat with me for a minute and asked if I wanted to leave with them.",1
"Anyway our talk basically went nowhere and she said she absolutely will not stop hanging out with the group. I didn’t tell her to, but I did tell her that it hurts me that she would engage with people who apparently have so many negative things to say about me, and I thought blood was thicker than water. Really it’s her callous “yea I see you’re in pain but I don’t care, get over it” type of standpoint that’s hurting me the most. I’m starting to think she too participates in the trash talking and I’m thinking of cutting her off too. Should I?",1

As time went on I would here everyday how I was too skinny, I need to gain some weight.. it got to the point to where I would ask questions about why I wasn’t good enough and was depressed ... he would throw a speaker in a room along with me and put stuff in front of the door to where I couldn’t get out.",1

"I would comfort her as much as I was able, and once when I was home on break, I even confronted my brother about his behavior. I tried to be empathetic and not accusatory, and have a conversation about his feelings and encourage self-reflection. I talked about how I suffered from depression in graduate school and compared my symptoms of increased irritability and desire to stay at home with his current behavior. He seemed receptive to the conversation instead of becoming defensive as he usually does, and ultimately I suggested he try counseling, as that helped me. He never pursued it, though.",0

Reasons she gave me were that I didn't do enough housework and she felt underappreciated for the work she did, that my libido is considerably higher that hers and it made her feel inadequate so she went outside the marriage to feel more like she could satisfy a person's sex drive, and that I'm boring and the newness of everything was gone. Now I'm here picking up the pieces and trying to decide if I can learn to trust her again, if I'm willing to put in the work, and what I could have done to be a better husband to avoid this.

I am terrified that one day the government will force people to have digital copies of their brain, or ""go digital"".

She dated that ex for two years, but never seemed that interested in him. She would complain about feeling like a caregiver for him (he was seriously depressed to the point where she had to make doctor appointments for him) and always talked about wanting to be with someone who was more independent and had their life together. As her friend I remember her saying she felt like he was good for her at the moment, but that she knew it wouldn't last forever (side note: she was open about her feelings with him, and he agreed to just enjoy things in the moment, though I'm sure he was secretly hopeful she would change her mind).",0
"I didn't have time to text a lot like I used to, and certainly couldn't realistically plan trips to see her anymore. She was plainly unhappy with me for not being as communicative anymore, but things really came to a head when I began dating someone. Lisa was the only person in my inner circle of friends to have a poor reaction when I told her I was dating another woman, which was shocking to me because I trusted her, and because she often used social media to convey her allyship with the LGBT community. She often told me that as soon as I met my gf, I quit talking to her (Lisa). As my relationship with my gf became more serious, Lisa and I became even more distant from each other, and she would often ignore my texts or emails (neither of us were ever much for talking on the phone).",0
Apparently it doesn't work that way. I don't drink or do drugs anymore (which didn't help keep me safe at all btw) so there is nothing to blur it out.

"He broke my hymen through overly aggressive fingering before we ever had sex. He surprised me by trying unlubricated anal sex without warning, and I did fight that one, but only out of complete instinct. I screamed and moved away and sat crying for an hour, unable to move or speak while he tried to apologize. After we broke up he became religious, and he publicly and privately called me a whore and a slut for stealing his virginity. I never defended myself or told anyone about what happened.",1
"I never did, but I pretend that I did, and I'm still in contact with her. Nobody would ever guess that I endured what I did. I'm in a competitive medical sciences program and thriving.

We recently started dropping hints to each other that we like each other and finally decided to discuss what we feel. She told me she loves me and wants a relationship.",0
"Her mother, who has been a full-time elementary school teacher for 28 years, is her primary caregiver, but when the mother is working as a teacher, this amazing lady needs a Licensed Vocational Nurse (LVN) to assist her with her ADLs and health needs so the mother can provide the family income. Her LVN attends to her physical and health needs everywhere that she goes during the day at home, in her college classes, out in the community, and her volunteering sites. She had good luck with LVNs, but her last LVN unfortunately no longer has worked with her since December. Since November, her family has posted the job opening six times online, asked all the local Vocational Nursing schools to post the job, and countless people posted the job opening on social media. No one applied for the enjoyable position, except for one, but she lasted for four hours and she decided that she didn't want the job after all.",0
"She approached me and started to say something but I interrupted saying, “If this is about my phone, I am under no obligation to share with you anything that is spoken between me and a therapist, and I do not care that this is during work, I have an emergency number to call at any time when I feel like I have to, and I felt like this was important as I don’t want to go back to the psych ward.” She stopped and just said “oh, ok sorry.” I understand that this may be a negative on my performance at work, and I may not be entirely right, but I have cut myself at work (not during work but after shift and right outside at my car) and the way I was feeling I needed emergency counseling. I have tried to have a conversation with her before about how I was feeling, but it didn’t go so well since she felt like I was being rude, so while I am open to trying again, I want to know how I should go about it again and/or should I get the manager involved?

I would really like to be able to hang out with her, like cook dinner, or go to a bar, or watch a movie, for example, and then just both go back to our individual homes and do our own thing. But, that seems impossible. I guess I’m really if it is necessary to constantly, physically, be with a S/O for a healthy relatioship to flourish?

I've always been told that I'm mature for my age and have never been anything near a problem child. I really don't think there's any cause for him to worry so much about me, and I'm terrified of standing up  to him because, frankly, he does stuff like take my phone away or monitor my spending, so I don't feel safe standing up to him.

"After getting startled, I have this thing where I'm really angry and defensive for 30-120 minutes afterwards. I can put myself in the most calm of situations, but the duration of this seems to be somewhat independent of my environment.

This is all 1 days worth of stuff and it’s not even everything but this has been going on for months. My mum says she doesn’t know what to do with me that I’ve always been mildly anxious but it’s just completely spiralled out of control since Christmas time. Also I can’t sleep I’m getting 5 hours ish a night and I used to get 8 hours everyday. I don’t know what to do whether I’m justified going to a doctor or I’m just being stupid and making people with real anxiety and other mental illness look bad I feel like I’m being stupid and I hate my personality.

"Eventually I reported the texts, as they kept coming, and I recieved verbal backlash from his friends for doing it (I live in a small community, running into him or his buddies all the time).

After a few days I start to try to make plans with her to hang out or go out to eat even if its only for an hour or so. She ends up saying no almost all of the time and I'm getting to where I don't even ask because I feel bad that she has to say no. And this leads to me feeling lonely and unwanted. The part of this that doesn't feel fair is that she can ask to do something with me at anytime and I basically drop everything to go do whatever she wants. I say yes to literally every thing she asks because I just cant help myself not to.,1

Last week, I was working nights and forgot to take my Zoloft four days in a row... I went into a crisis/withdrawal, started taking it again and on day three I felt AWFUL.

"Hey everyone, I’ve had quite the journey the last couple of years trying to get through a masters program in psychology to be a therapist and also dealing with health concerns. I came upon some research that led me to some conclusions that could possibly help some women who have gone through similar situations. So I was raped when I was 10 years old and gone through other various forms of trauma all throughout my childhood. I functioned pretty well until I got to my graduate program in clinical psychology. I had been in a stable relationship with a man who is supportive and loving so everything felt like it was going great.",0
"Clearly he's hurting inside and I want to get him help, but he refuses to get help because he denies he has a problem, and blames it on everyone else. He then punches me as a result of this, pushing me almost off my chair. I get up and push him away from me, and so he picks up my workbooks and flings them across the floor. He raises his fist above his head, and in defense I get the broomhead (not the broom - that's already been broken) to push him away from me. He then gets the broomhead and throws it down the corridor into my room with the door open.",1

Talking to her felt incredibly natural, and it seemed like we had a great back-and-forth rapport the entire time!

Needless to say, I jumped at the opportunity and asked her to dance at the first slow song.",0
"Hey, I recently came into a bit of money. I live on government benefits and I live in supported accomodation. I received roughly about £100 bonus money I'm guessing because it's the turning of the new year.

So he leaned in and kissed me with tongue. I was embarrassed because that was my first kiss. Then the next time I saw him he stuck his fingers in me even though I said no and unzipped his pants.

"As I get up from the end table, a bit dizzy, he takes the badminton racket and jabs me twice in the abdomen.

I thought about going to HR about it, but I'm in a position where I can't jeopardize this job, and I'm not the most well-liked person on the team (nothing that I did, I was hired externally for a position that 3 internals wanted), for whatever that's worth.

"I, too, am loyal to her. My insecurity came out pretty early in our relationship. I was still getting to know her and there was a lot to figure out.

"Something like that happened again. He was angry with me and wanted me to go to another room so he didn't have to look at me but I wanted to stay (not getting involved in any conflict or anything, just doing my studying and not interacting) so he took me out of the room by force, not hard again, but I got hysterical nonetheless. After calming down I continued my studies in the kitchen, trying not to think of what had happened and where this relationship was going. In about an hour he came to me and it looked like his anger was unresolved as he was provoking me. I decided not to get involved because this time I was genuinely frightened of what was going on.",1

"Long story but a few years ago my wife of fifteen years, who had never been with anyone else opened up and told me she fantasized a lot about being with other men, and considered herself somewhat polyamorous. I was upset and it took a couple of years of us discussing this before I started to feel more comfortable with things. We eventually started swinging (only about once every couple of months and always same room) as it seemed like a way for us to explore this part of her together, and it ended up being a lot of fun and something I really enjoyed that brought us closer together. Well, it’s been a couple of years and I’ve felt happy and comfortable with where we are at but  I decided to ask my wife the other day and she said she was happy but she also had a desire to date people separately, and would be willing to try it if I was. This was really hard for me to hear.",0
"On a side note, the mere idea of my significant other interacting in any way, hostile or friendly, with my brother makes me wanna freak the fuck out, so there’s also that. (But it doesn’t take much for me to wanna freak out either). Should I just continue to struggle privately to put this all behind me somehow? Also, is it selfish to feel the need to distance myself from my family right now while I’m trying to finally heal? (Like, moving far away so I have a non-hurtful excuse to only see them once every couple years)..",1
"I could really use additional input on this because I'm not exactly sure what a healthy and compatible relationship looks like at this point. When we try to go out and do things, we often do not have fun because our personalities clash. Example of this, I wanted to go kayaking and was surprised that he said yes because he rarely wants to be outside. We get to the springs to kayak and I want to go in the water because I see no point in kayaking if you don't go in the water. He refuses because he hates water.",0
"I thought we had an open door, honestly policy about our hook ups, but last week found out he'd made out with a few people during our relationship that I didn't know about. I got hit by a wave of how incompatible we are and tried to break up with him but I realised I was being a hypocrite and letting my insecurities control me and I mended things. ANYWAY, onto the issue. I had a pretty scary time with a friend of mine last night. He invited me around for a few beers, and maybe two drinks in he asked if I'd be down to have sex.",1
"Well, last time we fought, I did finally call. I was so fucking scared and while he hid in the basement with all the doors locked and light off, the cops took pictures of my hands and neck while I asked them over and over not to arrest him. They told me it will be up to the judge when he sees the pictures. Well, what do you know, he got a warrant. He didn't show up to the first court date so I know he's in even more trouble now.",0
"He said he had not felt that way before, suggeted I go rest and so ..TRIGGER AHEAD IF YOUI'RE A HYPOCONDRIAC LIKE ME: i decide to look up ""feelings of doom"" in hopes of maybe getting sucked into some rabbit hole of ludicrous conspiracy, a stupid ""are you psychic"" test or new age b.s., something I could even laugh at down the road. No, I ended up reading that this sense of doom can be indicative of various health ailments; one of which I am prone to.. So on top of my ""doom"" to my gloom..I am now f'n worried about my heart.

A woman doesn’t enjoy sexual play with her breasts anymore after breastfeeding because it’s a mammary gland and not a sex organ, and the husband gets pissed because he wants to touch her breasts and apparently isn’t aware of other erogenous zones.

So the first time I was at the dining hall and all of a sudden all the voices around me began to seem echoey and I had a spike of that warm panicky feeling in my body. I quickly got up to put my plate on the dumbwaiter and left the dining hall and it subsided fairly quickly, I didn't really think much of it. The second time was the following Saturday, where when I got back to my dorm I experienced discomfort/malaise from seemingly nothing, no triggers, nothing, just feeling uncomfortable and anxious. This laster for around 30 minutes.",1
"Does anyone else feel the same way? I am just too numb and burned out. I can love people but I can't fall in love with them. I can't give them what they need, the regular sex or the emotional intimacy, and I just end up feeling guilty. I can get along with them just fine, I can respect them and consider their feelings, but that's not enough.",0
"Another time I had one was today in class. I was worrying about fainting because I fainted last week and didn't want it to happen again. Today I was feeling dizzy from worrying and I was thinking ""I need to get out of here."" I managed to calm myself down by taking deep breaths and closing my eyes before it got too bad. Can someone tell me if these were actually panic attacks?",1
"Hi Everyone, I've been dating my GF for about 10 months, and everything is pretty good with the relationship. I think the two biggest weaknesses are my clinginess and her sometimes-poor communication skills. I like to express how I feel, and I'd much rather talk about the elephant in the room, whereas she likes to sweep things under the rug. We met at college, and her girlfriends from school have a group of guy friends.",0
"I asked for nothing but a declaration (a document detailing finances) from the divorce. He stole from me. I asked for nothing but restitution. He fought, forced me to hire a lawyer (more money), dragged out the case, and led to have alimony imposed upon if he failed to make restitution. He still failed to even honestly attempt to make restitution.",1
"So, I survived years of physical and sexual abuse as a kid. I'm finally at the place in my counselling where my therapist and I both think I'm ready to work through it. I really like her and trust her, but the guided questions she asks remind me of how few specific details I actually remember. Today she had me close my eyes to focus on where in my body I was feeling my anger, and it was like I was whooshing through a tunnel until she wasn't in the room anymore, and my body felt all weird and flat, my head would feel gigantic and then absolutely minuscule, my hands would be gigantic and then my feet.....I don't know how to explain it. It's like that scene in Inside Out where the characters become abstract shapes for awhile?",1
"I agreed and the four of us had dinner and I dropped them back home to Kate[18F]'s house where they were staying the night because her parents were not home. As I was pulling away Jamie[17F] ran up to my car and asked me if I wanted to stay the night with them, at first I was hesitant but I eventually agreed because I thought other guys were coming round. It turned out the other guys couldnt make it and it was just me and the three drunk girls. I asked Kate[18F](it was her house) if I could get some MDMA and drop it tonight and she agreed if I got her some. I drove us to the bottle shop where Jamie[17F] got her friend to buy us some more alcohol and went to get the MDMA which me and Kate did while Jamie and Sophie just drank.",0
"Later in life she would try for children with my great Grandad hoping for a Daughter and have four Sons and then finally a daughter that would later die. Now she's the only one of her 9 brothers and sisters still alive. As sad as all that is, honestly if she hadn't told me I would never have known. My Nan is the most cheerful energetic and lovely almost 90 year old that I have ever met. She looks 20 years younger than she is, and although she has multiple cancers, she still spends every day looking after my great grandad who she's been together with since her parents died.",0
"Hello r/assistance. My name is Cameron and recently I was denied my social security payments on the ground of my mental disability improving enough to be considered able to work. My doctor disagrees with their assessment and local social workers are helping me with my appeal.

"I quit Facebook, Twitter, and Instragram, essentially shutting myself off from the world. I go to school, but don’t talk to anybody outside of my family and my professors, and occasionally close friends. My mom says that it isn’t healthy, but personally my anxiety has gotten so much better. I feel good just feeling like nobody notices me. Has anyone felt this way?",0
"After talking with my psych she made me realize that anxiety has been the route of my negative feelings and it was likely anxiety causing depression. Despite this, however, she never seemed to understand just how severe my symptoms were. I would try to stay calm and describe how i felt to the best of my ability, however it wasn't until she saw me have an anxiety attack over asking her a \_very\_ simple question that she finally understood the severity. She said I seemed to downplay how I felt, so I took this into account for future reference. Eventually I move on to starting antidepressants, citalopram to start off.",1
I'm quitting my job in a couple of months but right now I don't feel great. I should work out a bit to feel better. I know that there isn't much to do but I needed to write it somewhere. Also I was so excited to quit my job and start working on building my app but I found out that I would need at least 30k$ and I don't have it. Now I feel like I'll need to take another shitty job to realise my dream some day,1

"I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life. Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc. You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value. I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events. You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.",1

The thoughts that have been pouring into my head theses past few days are terrifying. I wonder what driving my car off the side of the freeway would feel like. The relief that would come at the end. I feel so hopeless & I don't want to feel this way anymore. I wish I had a gaping wound so I could go into the hospital and they could fix me.,1
"And after every episode with them he treats me like shit for a couple hours at work I assume wondering if I know about his behaviour and if I’ll say anything. I completely ignore it and refuse to let it invade our work environment. It’s my world, and my people, and I’m his superior. He’s not going to win a power struggle, so I don’t even have to worry about it. Other days we get along fine from 9-5.",0
i remember her getting drunk and and ranting about a fuck buddy she was angry at. she came up with the brilliant idea of throwing a brick with a pie recipe tied to it through his window (i dont know). she told me to drive her to his house so she could do that and i said i didn't think it was a good idea. she told me if i didn't do it she would drunk drive there with my little brothers in the car. i haven't seen her in 6 and a half years.,0

"So now they are querying whether he has a traumatic brain injury suffered a year before we got together and that now he has progressing brain damage. At this point my nurse self kicks in, I can't not help someone in that situation. I feel sorry for him I don't want him to be hurt or alone. But I also want to hate him and leave. So my incredibly long winded question to you is this: if he has brain damage is this an excuse or a reason?",1
"She taught me a bunch at first. In the beginning of the week people asked what me and my Ex did. I informed them we broke up and it was due to infidelity on her part. This was not a cool move, however, I knew her sister would try to paint me as the bad guy. I was spot on.",0

Whenever I get in an argument with someone, I cry and it eats away at me.",1
"I'm scared, and I've been on edge for the past few days. He has two 4th degree felony charges and I'm so worried that lack of evidence will push the judge to reconsider his charges. My ex is claiming self-defense, even though I wasn't attacking him. I'm way too small of a person, it doesn't even make sense. He towers over me, how does he expect people to believe him?",1
"Well maybe afraid isn't the best word, but it's not far off. I'm not worried they can physically harm me or anything, nor do I even hate kids, most kids I actually like, but certain kids, like uncle's girlfriend's one kids, make me uncomfortable and make my anxiety go off badly. He's like 6 or something like that, but he is disrespectful to me, and harasses me when I'm around. He'll make smart ass remarks which although typical small child insults, get to me, not because they hurt my feelings so much, but it gets to me that I'm so pathetic, I can't even demand respect from a fucking child. Today, playing some backyard cricket with my brother and other cousin (a very respectful kid who I love), he asks if he can peg the ball at my groin, to which I obviously say no, so what does he do?",1
"I don't know how to maintain my relationship with my brother while he still lives under my parents' control \(which covers everything from finances, to communication with other people, to leaving their house \-\- or rather not being outside the house without them other than for school and work\). I'm lucky enough to have a few wonderful friends who supported me in various ways while I've been getting situated, but I don't know how to grow my friendships with them now that I have the freedom to. I got so used to not talking much to them as their other friends would, and I guess they're used to that from me. With new people that I meet, I find it very difficult to relate to their lives. I feel uncomfortable answering questions about myself, my past, and my background.",0
Does anyone else experience parts of their PTSD this way? &#x200B; Is this truly avoidance or is this dissociation? I tried to do some digging and pin down what I am experiencing so I can communicate with my husband more effectively but it isn't something that seems to fit nicely into a box and so it has been confusing.

How do I stop this without getting myself blacked balled or dealing with this harassment. TL;DR I broke up with my ex who cheated. I've been getting harassed by ex-girlfriends sister at my job. She holds a lot of weight in the company and her behavior has escalated. How do I stop this without getting myself blacked balled or dealing with this harassment.,1
"I honestly thought it might be similar to calling tech support, getting escalated to a manager, then actually getting results. I thought they might have resources I haven't had/didn't know about yet. They didn't, they called the police and filed a false claim (I was standing on top of a parking garage ready to jump - not true). Police came, spoke with me, decided I needed to go to the hospital against my will. I tried to reason and explain most of my depression and anxiety was financially related and this would make it worse.",0
"I refuse to carry both of us anymore and I'm also tired of the drama between us as well. So, part of me hopes he doesn't pay the rent and that'll give me my push to really move on.

Please no victim-blaminish phrases like the ""love yourself first"" motto, (I already love myself wildly hard) please no tough love.",1
"I know this will prob get doe vote to oblivion but every time i see this phrase it just feels so negative. Anxiety can be cured, you can feel normal again and you could even say that managing it is a cure anyway. People without anxiety manage fear and anxiety on a day to day basis it's just it comes naturally to them without even noticing, that's the point we need to get ourselves back to in order to be cured. I'm guessing I'm not the only one that feels de-motivated when they see this phrase so maybe use it less on here guys?",0

Im so in love with my wife when she’s happy and herself. We have everything in common.

There's never a moment where it is completely silent and I know it's anxiety and sensory overload, but gosh does it make me angry. My roommates talk CONSTANTLY and they keep me from being able to sleep because all I can concentrate on is their voices. Another example, in one of my classes today, my professor talked non-stop and she's one of those extremely hyper, fast talking, off topic teachers who go off on tangents about things that aren't related to the lesson at all. It was so hard to stay in that class without storming out because I couldn't handle listening to her loud voice any longer.",1

After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects. My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest. My blood thyroid hormones were measured, everything's perfect.",1
I’m just getting done with my training at my new job which I’m so thankful to have. It’s just that I’m down to my last $40 in my bank account and I don’t get paid for another 2 weeks. I’ve been eating peanut butter and jelly to get by but it’s becoming really hard and also depressing. I’ve never been this anxious about how I’m going to eat but here I am. Please help me.,1
"Hello, You are invited to complete a survey for a WMU psychology department research project designed to assess treatment preferences among adults seeking treatment for a variety of concerns. We hope to learn if and how preferences for treatment change over time, and if patient’s perception of their treatment’s match to their preferences is related to the benefit received from treatment. The survey is open to anyone ages 18 or older who is currently engaged in mental health treatment for at least one month and four therapy sessions, and not longer than one year. If you choose to participate, you will be asked to provide some demographic/background information, respond to survey items about your preferences for treatment and how they have changed over time, and about your quality of life. The survey may take between 30-40 minutes to complete.",0
"And I'm not a drug dealer or freaking anything like that. I'm a 20 something year old with no criminal record whatsoever so I figure the attack was accidental? This happened about 1.5, maybe almost 2 months ago. Basically, now I live with my mom and brother because the incident. She helped take care of me, fed me, all after I left the hospital.",0

When I try to befriend artists or thinkers or doers. They often either shun me because my work has been sub par and nearly non existant and they don't see me as equal. Or they show sexual/romantic interest I don't reciprocate which makes me nervous and avoidant. Sometimes I am shunmed I think because they mistake my interest in making friends for a romantic interest. I am quite annoyed by all the assumptions/game playing/projecting that goes on in the world.,1
"He abused his ex girlfriends as well. I left him last June, after he tried to kill me after being released from a one week sentence for DV. That incident landed me in the hospital, though it wasn't the worst incident of abuse. But that night, I had a wave of courage for two seconds and told the staff what really happened. He was arrested and has been in jail ever since.",0
"I loved her and I was completely broken. In July of 2016 I went out to a gaming hall/bar that my friend's family owns. I remember pushing on the doors to start making my way back home and then waking up in the hospital. I was told that I had suffered a traumatic brain injury (TBI), facial fractures, a ruptured right ear drum and a cerebrospinal fluid leak. I spent one week in the hospital before I discharged myself against medical advice.",1
"He was furious I'd 'kept' that from him. I had considered doing cam modelling though had never gone through with it (again before we even met) . He accused me of lying and keeping things from him. On top of that, he still expected sex all the time. I still liked it, but I was so stressed from the move and from the constant crying and fighting that my libido was down.",1
"In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",1
"I used to always feel I loved him more than he does with me, that was a common fight. And it turned out to be sickly true. I care so much for that man, I place myself in his shoes and feeling the pain he must be feeling being alone. I know this is sick of me, but how do I stop this?! I shouldn’t feel bad for what he did right?!",1
"I looked regular for once and it’s been a while to feel that way. I wanted to show who I was today to the world, it was empowering seeing that face I used to be especially when I saw him just a month ago. I left right away to catch any train heading to North Hollywood and eventually arrived at the area of my work interview. I was early but I know I made a mistake without considering how hard it is to panhandle especially when you don’t look it for the part. I had a sign with me and I asked people to spare me a quarter at most but all I got were weird looks.",0
He has anger issues and he seems like a good guy sometimes (even though i know he's a fucking monster) and i know he's had a bad childhood. It's even harder because if he does get arrested or something for it my best friend won't have anyone to support her/pay for her tuition or her meals even... her mom doesn't have the money to do that and i think that's why she still stays with them... just so she can support her daughter. My family would be willing to take her in but we're not doing well w/ money either.  I really want to do something about it but idk what i can do. He's been horrible to his family since forever.,1
"then i tried an ep of bojack horseman on my tablet, but it didn’t really help. for ex, after it was over, i still had my tablet on for light and i was staring up at the ceiling when the ceiling and the wall behind me started to ripple weirdly, distorting, and then the tablet light went off abruptly and i startled and yelped and quickly turned it back on! i also felt someone sit on my bed next to me when i tried to leave the light off and sleep. i distinctly felt it. i didn't hear distant voices like the other time i was this 'hypervigilant,' but i heard some small noise rustle in the closet (just a house noise i assume) and it unnerved me.",0

"I'm a bit jumpy as well as a bit of an animated person. Often I'll jump or exclaim something (even out of excitement) and it will activate my boyfriend's startle response. He will become extremely anxious and at times very angry. I am unsure on how to help him, because he said my current ways of addressing it are not adequate. When I asked him how I could be better at helping him through it, he became even more upset stating that he always tells me what to do and I need to figure this out on my own.",0
"I can't remember what was in the marital home when I left. I left under duress. I am still piecing together weird, incongruous chunks of time, flashbacks, disjointed memories, and trying to figure out what happened; it seems like my brain just can't access specific details when I'd like it to. The problem here, other than everything, is that I don't feel like my attorney gets why I'm such a useless participant right now, and I could use some advice on explaining it. Do I have my therapist call my attorney?",1
"But how do I keep going with this girl and eventually ask her to hang out again because no romantic relationship can really progress forward until we're physically intimate with each other, but we can't get there unless we hang out. And she doesn't even like talking on the phone and just texts. I feel like I'm having a relationship with my phone sometimes and it's like a female Wilson sometimes lol (movie Castaway reference for those who don't know).

"I'm afraid that I could also give her those snapchats. Usually I wouldn't care but first of all I know how much it would hurt her if She had seen it. I hate myself for lying but I just know how much it would hurt both me and Her, I also love Her more than anything or anyone else. I told her I won't be talknig with anyone and that I don't like anyone in that class (which I did). I have no idea what I should do, if I tell her that She's goin to breakdown and quite possibly break up, if I don't do anything it's gonn get even worse but I also can't tell that to her, I just can't hurt Her or see her get hurt and I just can't even imagine loseing her, especially because something that I know well I fu*ked up and could and should have been avoided but it happend althozght it shouldn't and I can't stand it.",1
